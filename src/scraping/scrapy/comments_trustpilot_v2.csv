The thing that I was most surprised of was the hoove quality. When I got him, the hooves were extremely broken. After around 6 weeks I could the that the new growing hoove is much stronger.

"Fantastic customer experience! We purchased a new 350L Jewell Tank from Lincs after visiting the store. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and we thought we would rather buy from a local store with good service than roll the dice and order from eBay etc for the sake of a £20 saving. We are so glad we did. Through no fault of Lincs, Jewell had uncharacteristically made some errors with the cabinet and the box contained the wrong parts. We called Lincs and they arranged for a cabinet to be opened up in the showroom and drove the missing parts over on the same day! Special thanks to Ben in the warehouse who could answer my pre-sales questions on the tanks like an expert and arranged for delivery on the day that suited us over the phone.

"I priced up butyl liners on line and when i rang them and asked their price they appeared cheaper so i placed an order. Although i asked to buy a butyl liner they sold me an epdm so i didnt price like for like and didnt tell me so i only found out after i had paid. I was a bit peeved about that but i was happy with their explanation and apology and they did delver it very quickly just a pity it did come with footprints on it as i thought its not a good idea to walk on a liner with shoes on!

"As the clamps are only required to be used for 2 mins max, DON'T buy packs of 10 (we had to buy a pack of 5 separately). The collars are of no use until the pups are several weeks old, BUT the pump to clear the airway was invaluable in our case. The scissors came in handy, but as the mother was VERY keen to eat the placenta, I found it best to squeeze the cord really hard to stop her ripping it from each pup and then cutting it ASAP prior to putting a clamp on.

"The Kan Teq body protector has an excellent quality and design seldom seen in modern products. I bought this vest because it stood out from all of its competitors in many ways. First, it has a more robust protective foam made by Knox, a leader in motorcycle safety technology. This foam provides a better force dispersion of a direct hit from falling on an object like a rock, and unlike the PVC nitrile in other body protectors it does not need to be replaced every few years or after a fall (making this a cost effective purchase for that reason alone). The panels are held by a very light and stretchy fabric that can easily be replaced to add years more use of the vest. It comes with shoulder protectors that protect the bony prominences of the shoulders and collar bones. The fit is customized according to bust, waist, and height measurements, therefore you do not need the adjustments of straps, buckles, or velcro. The result is a clean, sleek profile and a fit that is unsurpassed. I am 4'11"", a height that requires customization in nearly everything and limits me to a very few products that fit the way they are designed to. The owner of the company, Wendy, made an international call to confirm my measurements, my saddle and riding style, and to answer any questions. The body protector was customized by her, and sent from the UK to Texas in under 7 days. I am very impressed. Wendy is committed to her product in every way, and she has created something that I feel is the safest, most cost effective, and sleekest looking body protector on the market.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png
"I love my Kanteq protectors. I have two as I spend a lot of time in France.  They are worth every penny,  because if you injure yourself you risk losing everything.  I have had mine for about 5-6 years now, and they are still as good as the day I bought them. On first inspection they appear heavy, and potentially hot. Neither is true in practice. Once on and fitted the protector feels light and snug. They have a lot of movement in them. I regularly ride in Southern France where the temperature can be 35 degrees in the open, have ridden in Morocco and more recently on safari in South Africa when the temperature was at least 30 degrees,  absolutely no problem with overheating.  I suspect that in these circumstances the protector insulates against the heat in fact, and it certainly protects against UV light. And they do what it says on the tin! I came off on a mountain path a year or two ago as my horse spun, falling flat on my back onto rocks. I was aware of rock thudding into the small of my back but the impact was spread by the protector. I woke the next day without the expected pain after a jolt of that kind, no bruising at all  and I should add that I was in my early 60's so no spring chicken either! And the company are brilliant, friendly, helpful advice, fast responses. what more could one want!",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png

"Previous to my Harmony I had been riding in a Tucker Equitation, which I did love, but being a little ""deficient"" in the bottom area myself, decided to give the Harmony a try.  Where I couldn't make it through a long trail ride before, now I can with ease.  It is easily the most comfortable saddle I have ever owned.  The quality of the saddle is beautiful, if I ever have questions Tori is always willing to answer them. I now want to add some silver for the showing and a few extra rings for trail riding, and it is going to be no problem. My horses are very comfortable in the Harmony, it gives them the freedom to move, and it gives me the freedom to move the next day after a lot of riding!",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/westerndressageridinggear.com,Western Dressage Riding Gear,http://WesternDressageRidingGear.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/581b1c440000ff000596f9da/0x0.png

"I purchased a saddle last year to show in. My initials were custom tooled exactly the way I had sketched it on paper. It turned out amazing!

"I purchased a Harmony Western Dressage Saddle because I needed a saddle that really fit my fox trotter.  The flex tree not only fits both of my fox trotters, but my friend's quarter horse.

"I needed a light weight saddle with a wide gullet.  So ordered one from saddle on line.  It fits my horse and is 20 lbs.  The price was okay.  The leather is not very good quality compared to our leather on most US saddles.  It has a finish on it that scratches easily and is showing some cracking. But I am keeping it because of the light weight factor.  I took it to a saddle maker and these are the suggestions that he fixed or told me how to fix. You do have to make a couple of modifications though to make the whole saddle work.  The Latigo strap keeper (the cinch strap on the left side)  needs to be unscrewed, the the top of the leather keeper cut off to be able to move the keeper higher and towards the front of the saddle by about a half inch otherwise it rubs on your knee as you ride. It is easy to rescrew back on with two new holes in the reconfigured keeper.  Omearn the right side they used the same cut out keeper for a cinch tie up.  It doesn't work that way so you have to punch a round hole to put your cinch latch through to hold it up.  I've soaked the stirrups for several hours and twisted the stirrups.  Use a two by four board not the old fashioned broomstick (not strong enough) weigh the board down(I used paint cans) after twisting the stirrups several times.  He recommended leaving it twisted for 5 -6 days to really let the laqued leather and webbing dry.  Those are the saddle maker's recommendations to help make this saddle comfortable.  He also recommended replacing the thin Latigo on the left with a thicker leather one but the right one is fine. The screws used in the back are probably okay because of the thickness of a saddle pad, a single thickness blanket may not prevent soreness. Just be careful.",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/saddleonline.com,SaddleOnline,http://saddleonline.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4ee8e99c000064000511d8ce/198x149.png

"I ordered a shoulder guard for my gelding. For the past month or so, he had been shifting to keep us currying the muscle right above his shoulder and stretching his neck. He's retired, so a comfort, not a work issue, but he was obviously stiff and sore. I felt like I was kneading dough, longer, frankly, than I wanted to! I used the guard for three nights, about three hours each time, right after he went into his stall and then pulled it at the ten o'clock check. It was easy to put on and off and he didn't react at all. This sounds so weird but for the past three nights without wearing the guard, he no longer reacts when we curry his shoulder or neck. BOT says I can use it for the same length of time under the winter blanket he'll use pretty soon, if he starts getting sore again. Just knowing I have a tool to address what has been a pretty constant cold weather issue for him is fantastic. I also have a pair of BOT boots I've used if he or my mare get and stay stocked up and they take care of it.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/backontrackproducts.com,Back on Track,http://backontrackproducts.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/53345645000064000578777c/0x0.png

"Customer service is good.  Very cheap saddle and the moderator won't post any real reviews on their website about the saddles.  There were post that said that the saddle was high quality like a $2,000 saddle.  Not TRUE!  This saddle is made in India.  Very cheap!!!!!!!  The worst part is if you don't like it shipping will cost you $115 to return.  The saddle does not fit any horses properly.  It is cheap leather, very stiff, dry and cracking.  They spray the saddle with a shiny lacquer. Because the saddle does not fit the horse properly it tends to throw the rider forward when riding.  Not very secure like a saddle should be. You are better off spending the money on a good used quality saddle. UPDATE 7/18: Customer service reached out to me and sent me a shipping label to pay for the shipping.  I was impressed with how their customer service handled my dissatisfaction. I would suggest before you purchase actually speak with someone in sales.

I total paid under a $1000.00 and let me tell you the saddle feels and looks no less than $3000.0. I love my saddle and thank you saddleonline for offering one the most unique saddles I’ve ever seen. So if you like this saddle I would suggest pre order cause it does take some time to get ready.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/saddleonline.com,SaddleOnline,http://saddleonline.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4ee8e99c000064000511d8ce/198x149.png
"I just got my new saddle from SaddleOnline. I called to get some help and to see what would be the best saddle for my horse. Francesca in sales was extremely help full. She had me take a wither tracing and send it in to make sure the saddle I chose would fit my horse. I had decided on the Crystal Carved Brown Barrel Racing Horse Saddle, it looked just perfect in the picture also I really liked the rawhide horn and cantle. I also loved the fact that it was clearance for only $399.99, the saddle took about 5 days to get to me. But as soon as I opened the box it was perfect, seat was comfy and the fleece was very soft and well padded. I had also gotten a Girth and a pad to go with my new saddle and they were equally nice. Overall my shopping experience with saddle online was excellent and easy. I’m glad they have a knowledgeable helpful staff to help me. I would buy from them again.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/saddleonline.com,SaddleOnline,http://saddleonline.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4ee8e99c000064000511d8ce/198x149.png

"Trauma Void is replacing my helmet because of my chin strap issues. amazing that they are standing behind their product this way! I really like the fit and comfort of the helmet. Unfortunately the chin strap is a problem. It doesn't stay tight, and the daily adjustment means I have to remove the little chin pad, which is losing it's stickiness and not wanting to stay put anymore. The extra length of the strap requires that pas to not be sloppy. This is a shame because otherwise it is a fantastic helmet.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/traumavoid.com,Trauma Void,http://traumavoid.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,https://consumer-assets.trustpilot.com/assets/default-business-unit-image-198x149.svg

"I have been trail riding for several years. Have always been a fearful rider. Always wore a helmet. Five years ago my son ended up with a  Trumatic brain injury, that was work related(steel erection welder). Ever since then my confidence that I did have when riding went down the drain. I have become very  hyper vigilant in safety since then. Sometimes to much. So when I saw your new helmets with the MIPS i was all in. My son has the lasted technology in helmets in the motorcycle world and he has sent me stuff about your technology. Thank you for starting to change the  equestrian world. It does help knowing that I  do have more advanced technology on my head. Please continue to improve the  equestrian  Helmets.

"We had been trying for a year to get a pet through various rescues but the pets we wanted were always given to someone else. It was a very frustrating experience, especially after being told we were definitely approved. I found this service when I Googled “re-homing a pet.” The website is very easy to use and only showed the pets fitting the parameters we put in. We found a dog right away and after conversations with the owners, decided to set up the time to meet him. We met the owners and the dog but did not take him then. A few days later, we made arrangements to get him and paid the required fee. We took advantage of the free vet visit after the fact of adoption. That was probably the only part that we did not care for. The vet was very “disengaged” and because it is company-owned, we were quoted astronomical prices for various services we were encouraged to buy. We did get the vaccinations because the dog needed them, but left with the intention of finding a different vet altogether. All in all, though, our experience with Get Your Pet was very positive and I would use it again.

"I like this service, since an owner gets to meet the prospects and they can keep in touch, if wanted, and it gives them peace of mind that their pet, will go to a loving home, and not to a shelter, where they might live in lonelyness for a long time, and there is that possibility, they could be put down, if no one adopts. ALSO, the adoption fee is only $99. Some shelters charge $250 to $450 adoption fees.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/getyourpet.com,Get Your Pet,https://getyourpet.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5d7912f2b17b1600011bae56/0x0.png
This was so very different than adopting from a shelter.  Being able to meet the owners of their dog and learning all about the dog firsthand is wonderful.  We met our dog and spent quite a bit of time with him.  I also think it is better for the owners so that they can choose who they think is best for their dog firsthand also.  Still not an easy thing to give up your pet however the owner gets peace of mind.  Our dog has been a blessing and we are thankful.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/getyourpet.com,Get Your Pet,https://getyourpet.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5d7912f2b17b1600011bae56/0x0.png

We are very fond of our Pancake and feel lucky to have found her on Ger Your Pet. The only concern I have is really no ones fault but I would encourage anyone who explores this way of getting a dog do a lot of research about the families reason for getting rid of their pet.

"I adopted a dog from this site and was told they were never home and wanted to find a new home because of this. Said there was one incident of chewing woodwork. I have had dogs my entire life and felt it would be east to fix as I am home all the time - so no separation anxiety to cause this. I have had this dog for almost a year. He is a beautiful dog and doesn't have a mean bone in his body. That's where it ends. He is so destructive. He literally does not listen to anything!!! He has dog hole everywhere in my large fenced-in back yard. He is very rough. If I try to go to him, he zig zag so I can't catch him. If I am standing in his way, he runs right into me. I thought having him neutered would help - nothing changed. He and my other dog are in large cages only for time-outs so I can get things done. If he doesn't get let out when he wants out, he tips his entire water bowl on the floor of kennel. If he does not get his way, he dumps his water. If he is outside and I call him, he will either stand there and look at me or lat down. I believe he has had these habits all along and wanted to get him another home. Previous owner said dog did not act this way when they had him. I think the above problems were the reason they wanted to find him another home. This dog is impossible and does not listen to anything. I have never had a problem like this with any dog. The bad thing is that you have to believe what owner tells you and there is no middle-man to see if what owner says is true. I may have to get him another home.

I can't recommend Kitty Angels more highly; we have used them several times to look after our two tempermental cats and it's such a relief to know they are happy and well-cared for.

"I have used Kitty Angels twice now and my cats couldn't be in safer hands. Rachel visited us ahead of their first time and was really thorough - getting to know us, our cats and their routine to minimise stress to all parties whilst we were away. The second time one of our cats needed medication and this was all taken care of. They went the extra mile (and then some!) when said cat decided he didn't fancy taking his tablets after all. What I love most about Kitty Angels is that they send updates after each visit and plenty of photos of my cats playing, eating and having a cuddle so I can see they are safe and well. They also keep an eye on the house and are happy to do a few extra jobs such as putting the bins out, watering the plants and opening/closing the blinds.

I thought it would be something wonderful to protect her eyes if she walked into something but sadly, even following the sizing specifications it does not fit her. Because I put it together (of course to see if it fit) my understanding is it cannot be returned.",4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.arcatapet.com,ArcataPet.com,http://www.ArcataPet.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/47783f3a0000640005020b26/198x149.png

"I had an issue with a collar that I'd bought at Crufts in March 2019 (these things happen, its how they are dealt with that counts.)  I emailed the company and explained the issue. I received a very prompt response with an apology and an offer to replace the collar, no questions asked. This was a real boon because I have 2 dogs, 2 collars and 2 leads, all matching. To have lost one of the collars would  have been a shame. Despite the issues I still maintain that the quality of the materials are excellent and the items are well made. Thanks for outstanding service. Would not hesitate to recommend Oscar & Hooch, not the cheapest items but I doubt they try to be and they certainly back up their prices with great product and fab service.

Since I can't put one in the sliding  glass doors as they are hurricane impact, we found a place in our dining room..  We ordered it and Dan came in yesterday to install it.  It was a big job as we had custom painted walls and marble base.  He was able to cut though about 10 inches of solid concrete wall, then installed the hale pet door. He had to re stucco the wall around the door.  He did such a beautiful job, and cleaned up immaculately.  I would highly  recommend Dan.

"I have a very active 3 year old 80 pound Jindo.  After researching various screen pet doors on Amazon, one reviewer mentioned that Hale was the best.  That led me to the Hale website and although the Hale doors were more expensive, they looked a lot sturdier to me than what was offered on Amazon.  I decided to buy and install it myself, which was very straight forward with the supplied instructions. Well, after 6 months, the Hale door is worth every penny.  It's not only sturdy, but looks great.   Our Jindo loves the freedom of coming and going at will.  It only took a a day or two for him to get confident going through the swing door.  The magnetic sides really keep the bugs out of the house - its so much better than opening and shutting the door all the time.  I strongly recommend this product.  Also, if your dog is a rescue pet, like our Jindo, they will give you a 10% discount and donate to the rescue of your choice.  That's legit.  It was a pleasure purchasing form Hale and will do so again if I ever need to replace my screen pet door (which I may never need to!)",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.halepetdoor.com,Hale Pet Door,http://www.halepetdoor.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/5592f7f00000ff0005809a23/198x149.png

"Great product lasted 20 years of use by four dogs. When the time came to replace the door flaps viewing the video was certainly beneficial, though no where as easy as depicted when it came to removing old screws, several of which simply striped. Without the use of my Dremel and cutting discs to either cut the screws or create a good slot in the head for a flat blade screw driver, I would have been in serious trouble.  Anyway, after an hour or so of sweating and swearing, all is well.

They got the size spot-on, and included all of the parts along with complete, step-by-step instructions for installation.

"A few months ago we adopted a 5-year-old pit bull mix who was abandoned during the hurricane in Puerto Rico.  She is wonderfully sweet, but frightened of many many things, often anxious, and always aggressive with other dogs.  After 4 days of twice daily Cannimal RELAX, she is noticeably calmer and happier.

He also clearly communicated what we considered a reasonable cost for an experienced team who loves dogs and is so professional.

"Excellent business to do business with. Before having my fence installed I had 3 quotes from the top recommended companies in my area, according to a google search.

It was a pleasure having these guys come out, answered all question and left no doubt that this system would contain my extremely stubborn Red Healer.

"I am a Pet Food Nutrition Specialist and if you cannot make your own raw food for your pets, Darwin's is one of the nutritionally best foods I have found. I wish the main ingredients provided adequate vitamins and minerals so synthetic versions did not need to be added. I have a picky kitty that won't eat the food occasionally. I have found that when this happens, the food has a sweeter smell than normal.  Occasionally, the beef or lamb dog food is not ground up as much as the other varieties and my dog doesn't like the lumpy texture. Switching from a kibble & canned kitty food diet to Darwin's has naturally treated pododermatitis (an autoimmune disease) for one of our kitties.

"My German Shepherd was unable to digest any food off the shelf.  Trainers and breeders recommended raw food with raw chicken or turkey necks. A friend recommended Darwins several years ago, and here we are.  It includes the vegetables I used to blend for him as well as the high quality meats.  Cairo has flourished with Darwins.  He's nearly 8 and still has the energy of puppy.  I wouldn't change a thing; great quality, delivered on time, and super customer service with wonderful people.

"Great food for my cat!  My cat suffered from chronic diarrhea for over 18 months while my vet tried every test possible they could not figure out how to treat him.  We tried numerous different prescription diet foods, none that helped him.  Finally we found that a daily steroid pill was the only thing that helped his diarrhea. I was not comfortable giving him a daily steroid pill (which causes negative side effects) and so I finally tried Darwin's raw pet food. I stopped giving him the pill the same day I gave him the raw food.  His diarrhea went away IMMEDIATELY!  He is now healthy and has gained weight and no longer has to take the doctor prescribed pills. I could not be happier with this cat food.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.darwinspet.com,Darwin's Natural Pet Products,http://darwinspet.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5c90f6fa2c9dd50001cdd88e/0x0.png

I've been a Darwin's Natural Pet Food customer for over 4 years with our 12 yr old Havanese.

"I'm happy to find a company who makes toys for little dogs. Finding them are practically impossible. I know more people with small dogs, than those with larger dogs, who state the same complaints. Most toys are too big, bulky or heavy for a small dog to get a good grip on or carry.  The squeakers in the toys are located too far from the material edge, making it hard for a small dogs mouth to get to it. The most common questioning voice from people I know with small dogs is, why doesn't some company do a little research and make dog toys for small breeds? My dog is a 10 yr old, 12# Shih Tzu, toys galore, majority untouched. Her best and favorite? You know those dog faced head, long eared,  long bodied dog toys? This one has a much thinner body than those today. It's red, has squeaker in head and mid body, material very close knitted loop like thread. I've sewed it's ears on countless times, I've sewn up holes all over it's head, one eye is gone, mid body squeaker gone, but the one in head works and she can get her mouth on it to make it squeak. She's had it since she was 6 months old. The honest truth--there can be a pile of 10 toys on floor and she roots and gets this, because she can grasp in her mouth, anywhere. Hopefully you continue to offer small dog toys. I certainly will point my friends with small dogs in your direction.

"I needed a reliable indoor fence to keep my dog from going downstairs to the basement .  In the past I had bought one from on line but they were not reliable and could shock the dog when they were not near the location.  The fence by dog watch is exactly what i needed.  It never shocks unless he enters the zone, it gives him fair warning if he is getting close and I can control the amount shock he receives.  It is a great product and I would highly recommend this. Also, it gives us options on how we want to form the barrier which is helpful depending on the area you need to keep them out of.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/dogwatch.com,DogWatch Hidden Fences,http://dogwatch.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/596fa0650000ff0005a7016a/0x0.png

"We used to keep our lab on a zipline leash because he would roam off unlike our other labs. I was reluctant to get an invisible fence because I was concerned our lab would run through it chasing an animal in our yard. But he doesn't even come close to the fence and always stays in our yard! Our lab also used to chase cars, bikers & get into our trash but since he received his very first shock by the road during his training, our lab never goes close to that area.  We can set the trash out the night before and we don't have to worry that he's going to get into it now.  It has made our lives less stressful and more simple.Dog Watch was excellent to work with. They were happy to answer all my questions and knew how to train our dog. He was completely trained within two weeks.

"People shouldn't have to worry about their pets getting sick or dying because manufacturers us radioactive metals to make their feeding bowls. Basis Pet cares about your pet and it shows in their exquisitely crafted product.  I love the design and quality of the bowls I purchased from them and will continue to do business with them as long as I have pets.  Even my boxer, who was oddly timid during feeding time, is eating more easily since I bought her these bowls.

My girlfriend and I are thrilled with the look of my new dog bowls and stand from Basis Pet.  My previous dog bowl stand was covered in rust because my pooch splashes when he drinks and the materials were cheap materials. Now we have a stable stand and bowls made out of quality materials.  And made in the U.S.A. so we know they weren't shipped back and forth across the world so some poor worker could be paid exploitative wages.

"I was truly impressed with Mike and his love for dogs and my cat.  His home was clean and kept cool during the hot summer months. The true test of how well this new dog sitting venue worked was when Mike had to drop off my dog's leash the next day of my return.  When Mike came walking up the driveway, my Dutch Shepard, Scarlet whimpered uncontrollably with tail wagging up a storm.  Normally, Scarlet would have shown her teeth with a death growl to someone Mike's size. My dog was homesick for Mike!

"We booked with Anthony one night boarding for our Pomeranian dog,Indiana Jones. It has been the first time when Indy was left with someone outside of our family members. Because Indy is not used to strangers, we knew she would go through anxiety...and, of course, we were very much worried. Anthony was such a professional, kind and wonderful host. He was able to make Indy feel comfortable and loved. He has also provided us, on daily basis, with detailed information about Indy, as well as pictures. We will repeat the boarding for Indy with full confidence she will be well taken care of and not missing us that much.

My dog ran away recently. He digged right under the fence. When I realized he wasnt home it was dark out and so circled my neighborhood and surrounding areas over and over again with no luck. I never had to use petlink and I honestly forgot that he had it. He’s 8 years old and had it since he was a puppy. Just when I was about to give up I remembered he had the chip and went & checked my email. sure enough I had an email from petlink indicating where he was and the name of the individual at the facility. I was overwhelmed with joy and was so relieved. Thanks to this I’m confident that if I ever go through this misfortune again I will be able to be easily reunited with my pet.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.petlink.net,Petlink,http://www.petlink.net?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5b71e9fde0ef7900016160d2/0x0.png

"Miracle of miracles! Two of my three dogs had mobility issues with arthritist.  I was sad bcz it came on so fast. My neighbor is a vet tech and said it was arthritist and to keep them warm at night.  My other neighbor is animal rescuer and suggested anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidants.  I Googled both and saw the Nzymes ad.  I saw their video and the dog in the video was moving like my dogs.  Then I saw the results after two weeks...I thought dogs cannot fake arthritist.  I took advantage of the on line sale and received the tablets a few days later.  I smashed a tablet for one dog and two for two weeks for the most afflicted dog.  Wow! Single tablet dog still has hip dysplasia but can get up and down with ease and goes to bathroom outside, again.  She could not lower her hips to go to the bathroom but she can do it after a week of the Nzymes.  The 2 tablet dog was staying put all the time and resisted going for walks fearing to step down two steps.   After, two weeks she is side stepping again like a pony to tell me she wants to go for a walk.  So pleased with the results of Nzymes!",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.nzymes.com,Nzymes,https://www.nzymes.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5a9eeb4fcde81200015da216/0x0.png
Our dog became completely paralyzed out of nowhere and the vet couldn’t figure out why. I searched alternatives to having her put to sleep. I found Nzymes and read the reviews and thought what could it hurt to try. It wasn’t costly and if it helped that would be great. Within 2 weeks she was able to walk and within a month she could run. She has been using Nzymes for almost two years and still gets around great for being a 13 year old boxer. I recommend Nzymes to everyone.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.nzymes.com,Nzymes,https://www.nzymes.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5a9eeb4fcde81200015da216/0x0.png

"I must admit that I was expecting this bed to get chewed up.  I have had three beds prior to purchasing this one and all three were demolished in a very short amount of time. I have an Australian Shepherd and she is a very good dog but gets her feelings hurt when I have to leave her to go to work. She knows that she should not be chewing on anything, and as soon as I get home she bows her head to admit that she has done something wrong. I have had this bed for about a month. It is in perfect condition and there is not one spot where she has nibbled on it    I also purchased the extra large one because we have two other dogs as well. All three dogs lay on it very comfortably and I’m very happy with this purchase.  I read a few reviews that said putting it together could be a little challenging. I have to say that it was very easy and there were no difficulties for me. I would highly recommend this bed.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kuranda.com,Kuranda Dog and Cat Beds,https://kuranda.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5c5c8dbf3875930001df6a27/198x149.png
"Our dog had a typical fluffy pet bed, which he loved. We didn't have an issue with him destroying beds, but I had more of an issue of trying to keep it clean.

This is the first time we have dealt with Laughing Labrador for our DogWatch system. We have had this system for approximately 20 years. We have had to replace collars over the years and that was it. Our whole system finally needed to be replaced. Laughing Labrador worked with us and explained how the system had changed over the years and what we would need to do to make it work with our older collars. They explained that eventually we would need to upgrade those collars. They got back to us in a timely manner and were professional. I would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a system!,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.dogwatchlaughinglab.com,DogWatch by Laughing Labrador,http://www.dogwatchlaughinglab.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/58a4a88e0000ff00059cc114/198x149.png
Sale and installation of the fence was easy and hassle free.  Dave and Kathy were knowledgeable and quick to respond.  I was disappointed with the amount of time (10 minutes) that was given for the training.  Although Dave said he would come back if if needed.  I was also disappointed that there has been no follow-up after the initial installation and training.,4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.dogwatchlaughinglab.com,DogWatch by Laughing Labrador,http://www.dogwatchlaughinglab.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/58a4a88e0000ff00059cc114/198x149.png

"They sent my package to my old address across the country instead of my new default address. My new address was already in the system as default and I have already received something from them here. No idea how this package went to the other one. But when I called to ask for a pre-paid label to my address so that I can send it to the person who received my package, the customer service blamed me for what happened, saying I must have changed the address. Why on earth would I do that?! I already paid close to a 100$, now I have to pay even more to be able to retrieve my package from another state.

"After a year of being a customer, very disappointed in last contact. It was time to refill my prescription for Apoquel, and I saw that their price had risen substantially. I looked around, and found other companies had not raised their price. So I called them, hoping they would at least match their previous prices (I wasn't even asking for them to match the other companies, whose price was lower than their previous price; I wanted to try to stay loyal to them). I received a reply letting me know that they could not lower their price, it was out of their hands due to the company that made the drug. I wrote again, hoping they would make an adjustment since I had been a loyal customer. They told me they could give me a ""one-time"" code to lower the price to their previous price. They were less than friendly. That meant I would be paying the higher price in the future. And the code they gave me didn't even work. That's when I told them I would be writing online reviews about my disappointment with them. Only THEN did they change their tune, and a representative called me to see if they could make things right. Too late. I contacted Allivet. They guarantee lowest prices. Not only was their price substantially lower than Vet Approved RX, their service was exceptional - I received my purchase very quickly. I recommend Allivet.",2,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.vetapprovedrx.com,Vet Approved RX,http://vetapprovedrx.pharmacy/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5135e5830000640005236103/198x149.png

"I received some really terrible news after routine blood work of my young pup. It turns out after many additional blood tests costly specialist exam fees and even an ultrasound, he was diagnosed with renal dysplasia. This was incredibly devastating news especially to hear in such a young pup, my first ever actually, a real sweet rescue boy. Figo quickly reimbursed the difference for my policy and I am so glad I have them as a partner moving forward in trying to support my dogs congenital condition. It was so emotional and devastating finding out this news, that I can't explain how much this was lessened when Figo quickly covered the expenses. I'm hoping to give my pup the best life moving forward, and after experiencing this in such a young dog, I can't say how important it is for everyone to consider getting insurance.

"I was on the fence about getting health insurance for my rescue dog. She was relatively old when I adopted her, and I worried this factor would inflate her deductible and monthly premiums. I was also concerned about the ease of submitting claims, as I have an extremely demanding work schedule, and I don't have time to continually request forwarded veterinary records and justifications for services. I took the plunge via Figo after reading positive reviews, and I am so thankful that I found them! My dog was diagnosed with a hip injury a few months into our policy, and Figo has covered virtually every vet bill with no hassle. thanks to this insurance, we will be able to provide our dog with the care she deserves. I love Figo so much that I purchased a year of coverage for my friend's cat as a birthday present (for the friend, not the cat, she got a new feather toy).",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/figopetinsurance.com,Figo Pet Insurance,http://figopetinsurance.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/56168b580000ff00058427fe/198x149.png
"I used FIgo for three months but recently cancelled them for another insurer. I'm giving them two stars because their customer service is good and we always received prompt responses. My issue with them is pricing and the structure of their insurance. They charge a higher monthly premium than other insurers. They charge the co-pay prior to applying the deductible, which, frankly, is ridiculous. It makes no sense that they should be reducing your out-of-pocket expense by the co-pay before applying it to your deductible. Lastly, they don't cover the cost of vet fees. I'm honestly surprised they have as many customers as they do with a structure like this. I switched to another insurance company which will save me $20/mo, covers the cost of vet fees, and applies expenses to the deductible before co-pay. No brainer.",2,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/figopetinsurance.com,Figo Pet Insurance,http://figopetinsurance.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/56168b580000ff00058427fe/198x149.png

"My dogs stayed with a Rover dog sitter for four days earlier this month. Our Rover sitter had her own dogs there and other dogs she was watching. All this was totally fine as  we have had this sitter in the past and she handles multiple dogs great! When I picked them up on 9/14, they came home and developed diarrhea. Our golden retriever had it the worst !   To the extent, we put up baby gates in the kitchen (the golden is 9 years old so these baby gates are not used often!) because we had poop everywhere. We took her to the vet. Our vet informed me she was infected with a parasite. The vet said it came from a dish, water bowl, the yard or another dog.  Our shetland sheepdog then started showing signs of the parasite about a day later. Luckily he didnt have it as bad as he is 13 years old.. We cared for him, giving him a bland diet. Within three days he got worse and we took him to the emergency vet. It took about two weeks for the dogs to look and play like normal. This was extremely stressful after coming back from vacation.   We love our dogs - they are part of our family and we will do anything for them. But the bills added up quickly to keep them healthy. Vet: $366.00 9 Cans of Rug Cleaner - $45 (nothing worked either... wil need to replace) I submitted this issue to Rover and asked that other people that are taking their dogs to this house be told about tthe parasite. How many other dogs are getting sick? I also asked to be reimbursed for the dog’s stay or to be paid for the vet bills as this was obviously contacted at the sitter’s house. Rover.com refused to help with anything. They said NO - No infections are covered . REALLY ?   They have no liability. i ask myself.. what is covered   ???? Is this somewhere I want to take my dogs again? No. How can i ever be sure that there is not an issue at another person’s house? Wasn’t the luxury of using Rover.com so you didnt have to put your dogs in a kennel and they could be comfortable while you are away? Rover.com doesnt stand by their own business plan as they are not monitoring or reviewing any sort of “condition”  their pet sitter’s houses are in. I have used Rover for YEARS. I will never use Rover again. I am just thankful that the unkept house didn't kill my dogs.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/rover.com,Rover.com,http://rover.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/53f4db2b000064000579d48a/198x149.png

You get 3 stars for quickly replacing my first order.  It was received in poor condition.  The box was saturated with the contents of one bottle (empty) and the second partially drained.  Both bottles were essentially opened as the twist on cap was loose and the paper seal under  the cap on both bottles was peeling off. I called and told them of my experience and they promptly reordered.  I received it today.  One bottle was in a similar condition with a few small drops showing on the inside of the box.  The other bottle seems sealed. You should work on your packaging.  These bottles are prone to such failure and both packages were received in identical shipping.  Nothing to stop leaking if the bottle tops are not sealed. Now to see if the product works. :),3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/thepetlabco.com,Petlab Co. ,http://thepetlabco.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5c9df8263ff4c4000185ea05/0x0.png

"I got a 30 day free certificate for pet insurance.  First, they denied my claim.  Even though it took the process over 14 days from the day I submitted it.   I think it was worthless to have a 30-day free pet insurance especially I was denied.   I think they are super expensive.  They charge over $100/month for two dogs just for accident and illness.  I pay $60/month for two dogs from somewhere else.   Then they have a pet wellness plan offered but it's only an additional cost on top of the accidental and illness plan.  It would nice if they offered the pet wellness plan as a separate plan.  I thought this insurance being part of the AKC...it would be affordable and worth it.  But when you get denied and its expensive....at the end it's not worth it.  I think you're paying the name ""AKC""   I definitely would NOT recommend this insurance company!",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.akcpetinsurance.com,AKC Pet Insurance,http://www.akcpetinsurance.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5a56611a8f1a4f056c7854d1/0x0.png
The insurance plan I have is supposed to cover heart worm prevention and flea and tick prevention. I do not buy through my vet because it is less expensive to go through Chewy's or 1-800-Pet med.

"I highly highly do not recommend this insurance. We purchased this insurance the day after we purchased our puppy and thought we were in the clear when he experienced health problems, however just like most insurance companies they always find a way to get out of paying your claim. This insurance claims they will cover the costs of vet visits for UTI and ultrasound just to name a few, but guess again they won't. Get this insurance if you would like to pay extra money for no reason on top of your already expensive vet bills otherwise, look elsewhere. There is a reason this insurance is cheaper than others and it shows.

Dog Watch has the only dog containment system that works for our Brittany. In the past we have used a system from Innotek and this Brittany has quickly figured out the system and was constantly willing to take the shock to break thru that system. Not... the Dog Watch system even though we are up on the 6th of 7 shock strengths it really works for us. We have about 2 acres next to a main road exceptionaly busy during the summer months.

"We ordered the e-collar 1900S. It's taken 3 days of me keeping on eye on our German Shepherd. He was always running out on to the street or running to the neighbor's, but this collar has saved us so much $. Instead of buying an electric dog fence, this collar has broken him of this. He used to run out on the street and viciously bark at neighbors and dogs walking by, but not anymore after buying this amazing collar. I am impressed. I like that there are minimum settings. He responds well to just the minimum.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/dogtra.com,Dogtra,http://dogtra.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/58dbf1860000ff00059f7685/0x0.png

The e collar we have from Dogtra coupled with an excellent trainer who taught how to correctly use it has made a dramatic difference for our dog.

"Ordered medicine (Atopica for cats) Sunday evening. Status of the order is ""Waiting for approval"" all day Monday. Tuesday morning, I tried to call PetVM - call is going straight to voicemail. Left a message, and called my vet - sure enough, they have no requests for approval. It took multiple attempts to reach PetVM on the phone or via email, finally a person with Indian accent (denying calling from India) got on a conference call with my vet and myself, asking for verbal approval. After he was given the approval, started asking questions about instructions for the medicine (!), ignoring my attempts to explain that we're using the medicine for a long time. This is when I finally lost it - needless to say, my advice will be to steer clear. EDIT: Shortly after my initial negative 1-star review was posted (apparently, businesses get automatically notified of the feedback on this site), I was contacted by a nice woman from PetVM (Montana), who apologized for the delays and the negative experience I had, and shipped the medicine right away.

"I trusted this company with my dog's health, and I think I got scammed.    I thought I was getting a great deal when I discovered my dog's arthritis medicine in a 3-month supply for quite a bit less per pill than I usually get it.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but AS SOON as she made the switch to the new Petvaluemart meds, she was in pain and limping and has continued to be ever since.  I tried to contact them to ask to return the remaining pills (over $100 worth!!) for a refund, but they never responded.

"I decided to this company based of the reviews. I tried the dog food and it just did not work for my dogs. Though they liked it, it made their stomachs very upset, I emailed in and told them I wanted to cancel. A rep Aimee emailed me back saying she could freeze my account so no orders will get sent out until I email them. This is not what I wanted. I wanted to cancel. I saw yesterday my card was charged. I emailed right away trying to figure out why. My account still had not been canceled. I was told by Lauren my response to Aimee was never received and my account was set to be shipped. Response received or not, they already had in writing from me that I wanted to cancel. Her response were that no changes were able to be made and I would get the delivery today. Umm no? I gave you plenty of time to cancel/reroute the package. I have no use for this. The customer service is horrible and I will be disputing the charge and filing a complaint. Use another company.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/nomnomnow.com,NomNomNow Dog Food,http://nomnomnow.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/59a065410000ff0005a9ae0d/0x0.png

"NNNOW is the only food my LULU2 will eat -- honest!!!  Took a lot of trials to find something she liked.  It arrives in good time, in good condition, fresh frozen with a complete list of ingredients (real food), so I know it's good for her.  I live in a 450+ unit apartment complex and I appreciate the email notice when it's en route, so I know when to expect our shipments.  And, if/when I need to communicate with the NNN staff, I leave an email or phone message and they're always quick to get back to me.  Sure, it's only dog food, but NNNow's the best dog food for the best dog in the world!!!

"The dog walkers have been great. It's super easy to schedule a walk and super convenient.

"I gave Aquatic Warehouse 5 stars because they actually read my notes in my order. I asked to please not send me this filter if it is not the most up to date filter. I purchased the FX6 canister filter from Petco off of Ebay and they didn't send me the one that was pictured on the website. When I received it, it was the wrong one. They refused to exchange it. So I just returned it. Thanks to Aquatic Warehouse I received the most up to date FX6 filter and paid $22 less for it. Aquatic Warehouse was quick to respond to me via email and a phone call from Pat assuring me that the FX6 canister filter will be the most up to date filter available. I received my filter within a week of my order. I was able to set up my 300 gallon turtles tank July 1, 2018 with my FX6 Canister Filter. So far I love they way it is working. Thank you Aquatic Warehouse and Pat for being so prompt with your service.

"I placed my initial order with Pet Treater on August 7.  One August 9, my account showed that Newgistics had picked up my order to deliver to USPS. One week after placing my order (August 14), it still showed that my order still had not been delivered to USPS.  I contacted them and was told that my order was shipped out on August 13.  They told me that it takes 48 hours for tracking to show any movement. As of August 15, my order still has not been received by USPS. I canceled my subscription.  It's sad because I was really looking forward to this. I may never receive this, but that most definitely have my money.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.pettreater.com,Pet Treater,http://www.pettreater.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/594000e50000ff0005a47c73/0x0.png
"I have had a subscription to pettreater for over a year now I believe. Bandanas were not in the box when I first started and it kinda sucks that the cheap piece of fabric that unravels counts as 1 item. You usually get a themed box but sometimes you don’t. You always get a cookie with icing. This month I was sent 2 to make up for another item they didn’t want to give me I guess. I have received 2 packages now full of ants and I will be canceling because of this. The first time I had to throw everything out except the toys. They went into the wash before use. The company sent me a new box but sent it to the wrong address (my old one) which is my moms house and 30 minutes away which is very frustrating. This second time I have another box with ants. I check my mailbox and no ants in there. I’ve ordered medicine and no ants got into it. The box has a sealed bag around it so it must’ve been packaged with ants. I believe the cookie is the cause of the ants. Whether the cookies come straight from the company or sit in warehouse to be packed I don’t know. Overall this is a fair box. Some months you get poor items or things you might not use. I got a water purifier for camping? I’ve gotten sample sized treats as well. The most recent treats I gave my dogs caused 3 to get diarrhea. That was the only thing they had different that day so I would say it was the treats so they go to the bin. The toys usually 2 a month, are decent quality. The newest box one was destroyed in 10 minutes. The other will last a while. Usually you get a stuffed toy and a harder toy. You get 2 treat bags. A cookie and a bandana. Sometimes you get different items like a coozie or spray for your dog like deodorizer. I would overall recommend this company but after 2 ant infested boxes I would say buyer beware.",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.pettreater.com,Pet Treater,http://www.pettreater.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/594000e50000ff0005a47c73/0x0.png

My husband is the ""king of research"" and would never make a decision this important to our family without a thorough check. We have had our puppy now 5 weeks and are so in love.

"Collar #3 I am looking forward to the day when Julep's neck is full grown, then I want one of EVERYTHING. For those of you who look and leave, and say, I am not spending this much or wonder if they are worth the money - Let me just say this, they are truly beautiful, sturdy and worth every penny.

"Since using scumbles dog food for Gizmo, I have noticed only positive changes including mental advancement, physical development & social interactions. Gizmo was never hard to train, however since changing his food to scrumbles that contains DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) he seems more alert and focused. Being a chihuahua, the DHA also helps his little joints The differing kibble size depending on your breed of dog. The kibble the Scumbles Gods have put Gizmo on means that there is high protein as he is still developing physically and also because he is petite the small kibble means he eats without it seeming like a chore to him! Aside from the DHA, since being with Scrumbles, his skin is not flaking (no dandruff woohoo!) and his coat is shiny, soft and silky like never before!! As Gizmo is out and about often, he not only eats and enjoys the scumbles dog food but they have a variety of snacks and training treats that are so good for him. It’s one of the only foods he eats and shares with his other four legged companions. Thanks to Scumbles, Gizmo is a healthy weight and always has a smile on his face and is currently waiting his next play time.

"I have had my 2 dogs on their 100% plan for a few months now. At first I really liked it and the dogs seemed to be as well. From what I can tell the food is good quality and What has made upset with this company is that they have consistently been putting less food in my dog's packages than what the weight on the package says. And when I called the representative only gave me the reason/excuse that they don't operate in a mass produced factory so that happens. That's it. Like starving my dog is okay. And when I say starving, I'm not exaggerating. My totally healthy dog has lost over 5 lbs in the past 1-2 months. And she's become food aggressive with my other dog. Once I started weighing the packages recently, it all made sense. I gave the company a chance to make up and correct it, but they only wanted to offer an excuse and wouldn't even let me speak to someone else. They're untrustworthy and have no problem starving animals to make more of a profit.",2,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.myollie.com,Ollie,http://www.myollie.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5cb680e523137100015bcafb/0x0.png

The consistency of the food isn’t very appealing to my dog. He has a harder time eating it when it’s gooey and watery. The amount delivered takes up my entire freezer. I would personally prefer to get 2 week deliveries so I save freezer space.,4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.myollie.com,Ollie,http://www.myollie.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5cb680e523137100015bcafb/0x0.png
"On the one hand, the dog adores this food, so that's a plus. As far as the experience of Ollie, it has been mixed. One of my major issues has been the lack of consistency in the food itself. Sometimes a whole batch is sticky and gooey and sometimes it's like a more solid brick that crumbles easily. As far as the whole redesign, I do not like getting as much food as I do. It seems a little out of touch to expect people to be able to fit all that food in their freezer at one time--and it's A LOT of food at once. The individual food packages are so small, we have to really stay on top of things to make sure we are taking more out of the freezer with enough time to thaw. The plastic container they sent ostensibly to store the thawed food holds two of the tiny food packages, but it seems pointless to open up a food package and empty the food into the container just to scoop it all right back out at the next feeding. The one nice new thing is the food scooper. It cuts through the food beautifully and makes serving the food much easier than the awkward scoop they had before.",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.myollie.com,Ollie,http://www.myollie.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5cb680e523137100015bcafb/0x0.png

"Our dog, Dooley Dawg is loving the new packaging and food.  He eats the food without adding other products to it.  He is very finicky when it comes to his meals.  He lays and waits in the kitchen for his meals now instead of me coaxing him to eat.  The new packaging is a great plus.  I have actually taken the food out of the package and put it in a microwave safe plate and defrosted the food and then warmed it a little and fed it to Dooley.  Dooley prefers his meal warmed up for a minute 15 secs in the microwave.  He is a little spoiled.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.myollie.com,Ollie,http://www.myollie.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5cb680e523137100015bcafb/0x0.png

"I love this food and this company ! After years of sensitive stomach issues, we had Stewie on prescription canned food from the vet. I felt awful about the junk that was in it, but he couldn't tolerate anything else. I even tried cooking my own organic ingredient food, but he was lacking nutrition. He was always low energy, had stomach and yeast problems, ear infections and bad breath. After 1 week on Ollie beef formula, he became more alert and more active. We are about 4 weeks in , his coat is beautiful, his eyes are clear, his breath is great and so are his ears !I love the recyclable products and the customer service is wonderful !!

"Our puppy arrived safely via airplane to us. She was perfect, happy, and beautiful. I could tell she had been very well socialized, especially with children, and loves everyone she meets.  She is very quiet (I think we've heard her bark five times only!) and has the sweetest temperament. An absolute doll. She was easy to train, and already a perfect addition to our family. Any new puppy can be a little stressful when you are worried about losing sleep, potty training, etc... but I will say she is so smart and learned so fast. We are so impressed with how much she has learned. She's already in the early stages of becoming a therapy dog and the smartest in her class! :) The process of picking her out was extremely easy. Galen was kind and answered any and all questions I had very quickly. We are so lucky to have our new pup and can't even put in to words how much we all adore her.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/mygoldenretrieverpuppies.com,My Golden Retriever Puppies,http://mygoldenretrieverpuppies.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/597778ef0000ff0005a76789/198x149.png

Bought two vivariums spent nearly £370 . 3 weeks later and still not received them. Ive sent several emails and not had one reply. I bought these in good faith.  They have no contact details. Luckily i paid through paypal so should get my money returned. even paypal cannot get a response of them. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY !! THEY ARE SCAMMERS. UPDATE...I WAITED OVER 21 DAYS FROM PAYMENT AND STILL HAD NO DELIVERY OR CORRESPONDENCE (AT THIS POINT I MADE PAYPAL AWARE OF THE SITUATION AS BEFORE THE 21 DAYS YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN WITH NO ITEM RECEIVED).

"Our 9 yr old daughter rides religiously at our local stable - Her horse is about 8 years old and started to show weakness in their joints and overall sluggish digestive system. One of the farm stable hands recommended a company called LVPerformance, so we looked them up online and found they had probiotics for horses - My wife called them up and spoke to the manager / owner? Mike. He was on the phone with her for about 20-30 minutes going over what the best plan of attack would be for a sluggish horse.

"I went in to my order figuring that it would not get filled, based on how basic the website looked and a few of the online reviews. Most of the reviews were pretty good though, so I tried it out. I ordered two boxes of Revolution for cats, as it was 50$ cheaper than what I would pay in the US...and that price included shipping. I chose the shipping without tracking as the other option was quite a bit more. My order came in exactly two weeks later. I had emailed 13 days in to customer service and I got a reply about 10 hours later, I imagine due to the time difference. They said if I didn't receive my order soon, they would replace it or give me a refund. I didn't need to either of those thankfully. The medication was in metric packaging [Stronghold].

"Our dog Ruthie has had problems since she was just a few month old.  She has been in and out of the hospital.  She has had to have multiple x rays, seen a neurologist, undergone an  MRI, and been on pretty expensive medicine for almost a year now.  We are so thankful for Petplan.  They have been there the whole way with the treatments for Ruthie.  It has always been a very easy process and they pay right away no extra questions asked.  I am forever grateful for Petplan, without them we would be in a huge amount of debt.  Now we can care for our dog and not have any added stress worrying about how we can afford it!",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"I’m so glad I signed up for Petplan Pet insurance for my dog Kimber. Not even four years old, she needed surgery to remove multiple lumps from her back and legs. One thing I didn’t need to worry about was how I was going to be able to afford her surgery. Within days of submitting my claim, a check was in the mail.

"I honestly am so upset at myself for not doing research before going with PetPlan. My dog has been relatively healthy up to this point (9 years) but lately has had some issues with recurring bladder infections as well as heart issues. EVERY single time I submit a claim with PetPlan, I get an email saying my claim will be reviewed within 10 - 15 business days. I've not once had a claim reviewed and finalized earlier than ONE MONTH!. Not only that, they currently owe me about $1,200 over three claims and one cheque (around $600) I have been waiting for for TWO MONTHS!!! This is completely unacceptable for a business to run this way. I am now experiencing some financial hardships and really need this reimbursement but every time I reach out to them they come up with one excuse after the other (the mail must have gotten lost, etc.). I have never had any mail get lost so there is no way this can happen twice in a row. Honestly, if it wasn't that I could never live with myself if my dog got seriously ill and I didn't have coverage, I would have cancelled months ago. DO NOT GO WITH PETPLAN!",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"I had heard about petplan from other people and thought that their structure was credible and straight forward to work with. Their reimbursement format is sketchy. I had insured our cat (30$ per month) and had incurred over 600$ in bills from two vet visits. When submitted for claims, they got rejected missing documents which I had already uploaded online. Customer support is extremely unhelpful and does not clarify what they need to process the claim. We are doing okay for where we are and honestly it's not worth the hassle haggling with petplan if you can look at alternatives which work with vets directly.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png

"I wish we could give ZERO STARS. DO NOT TRUST THE 5 STAR Reviews... they are NOT REAL. I've been paying this insurance for a few years now and recently my GSD had an injury and we noticed him panting heavy. We took him in to get his heart checked and his leg and hip. After tests it showed his heart was fine and they couldn't find anything wrong in the X-rays on his leg, hip was fine. So the doctor referred us to an Orthopedic to get his ligaments checked. But first I wanted to send in the claim for the tests. Well guess what I found out... PetPlan takes forever to get back to you, and then just asked for more documentation and then gets back to you again for more documentation only to turn around and tell you it's not covered. They are the WORST...ALSO THE RATES GO UP EVERY YEAR.. THIS YEAR 165.00 PER MONTH.... THAT DOESN'T COVER ANYTHING!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS .....",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
If you try to put a claim in Pet Plan does everything in their power not to pay.  My dog had surgery and need to go to ER per his regular vet's instructions less than 48 hours later.  He was having complications due to surgery/medications his primary vet and I believed.  Petplan insists that since they found a UTI in addition to side effects from post-surgery meds that the deductible must be met again.  It is all tied together as were the tests but again they are screwing their customers.  If my dog was not so old I would change companies.  The new underwriters have made this one of the worst companies to buy insurance from.  For those of you who have not started with this company USE ANOTHER COMPANY.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"I have been with petplan for 14 years but since they got a new underwriter life has changed. I have a 14 year old who has been healthy until the last year where he incurred a lot of medical expenses but has pulled through the issue. When came time for his annual renewal petplan raised my premium from $1642 to $3,600. Petplan won't cancel you but they will raise your premium to try to force you to cancel your policy. It seems as though they only want to insure healthy pets. Be sure when looking for a insurance company that they do not base your premium on number of claims and age of your dog. Petplan also has the right to change your coverage at any time. I also had a friend who had her coverage reduced due to having a back issue with her dog",2,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"How much are you willing to spend to make sure your four-legged baby is healthy, happy, and safe? I'm glad I don't know the answer - because it's probably everything in my savings account, all my credit cards, and my right arm. I still have both arms and no debt thanks to PetPlan's coverage of my beloved puppy. Brody, less than two years old, is suffering from a serious muscular condition that has caused him intense pain, exhaustion, and muscle-atrophy all over his body. He is the happiest dog on earth, and it has been awful to watch. Unfortunately, he did not respond well to the usual treatment options and after almost two months of trying different things, we eventually ended up in the emergency room. After a couple days in the hospital and a neurological consultation, Brody is on a revised ""get healthy"" plan and improving slowly each day. Between the vet visits, the recurring bloodwork, the prescriptions, anesthesia for exams (too painful to do without), a cancelled vacation due to emergency treatment needs, emergency room bills, and everything else that may be coming our way, we were (and are) looking at thousands of dollars in care. PetPlan has been there since Day One. When Brody first received a diagnosis, I called PetPlan to make sure I understood where we were headed financially. The first thing the person asked me was, ""How are you and Brody holding up?"" That's how all my interactions with PetPlan have gone - they ask first about our well-being, then answer any questions openly, honestly, and quickly (I've never waited to speak to a real person). The most recent time I spoke with a PetPlan representative, I called in a panic because the bill for Brody's emergency room visit and subsequent hospital stay was a big burden and the hospital refused to work with PetPlan for payment directly (they required it up front). The person I spoke to at PetPlan - once again, asked how Brody was doing - and then assured me that she understood the issue completely and would do everything she could to get the claims expedited. They were approved and a check was in the mail within 48 hours of that conversation. I can't say enough positive things about my experience with PetPlan, and I hope this story encourages you that it's the right option. I know other doggie-parents who have had very different situations, and I am so glad that PetPlan has never asked me to choose between Brody's well-being (or even his life) and my financial stability.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png

"I just got off the phone with Sarah, a Pet Plan customer service provider, and as ALWAYS was impressed with the quick and capable handling of my questions.  I've had Pet Plan for many years and I too experienced the underwriter change, but have zero complaints.  My Golden Doodle has had many claims in his 9 years and every single one was handled exactly the way I was promised it would.  I choose to mail in my claims and would advise anybody to collect a copy of every chart note generated about your pet as you get your reciept (invoice) for that service.  I've never had any problems with any service provider, not once. Recently, we had two larger claims including one for an emergency procedure to untwist my dog's stomach (GDV).  This is an expensive procedure without which he would have died.  I honestly don’t know where we would be without Pet Plan.  Pet Plan has played as big a role in in our dog’s health, well being and happiness as any who love, play with and help watch over him. I am forever grateful to Pet Plan and wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone.

"I cannot possibly say enough about Petplan. I have had Petplan for three of my dogs.  Petplan paid for surgery and radiation for my golden retriever.  Petplan also paid for expensive medicine and initial and ongoing tests related to my sheltie's heart disease, as well acupuncture and laser therapy (I think they reimbursed me close to $30,000 during her 12 years of life!).  Now I have a lab mix and she just needed surgery for elbow dysplasia and they paid for that. The claim process is simple and reimbursement is fast.  I tell everyone I know who has a pet or thinking of getting one that they should get pet insurance, and I HIGHLY recommend Petplan.  It is peace of mind when your furry family member needs medical treatment.  I am so thankful for Petplan.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"Good luck joining PetPLan, make sure you know ALL your pets 'pre existing' conditions, along with inventing time travel then you should be sweet. We did not know our pet had a ‘pre-existing condition’, we are not trained vets.  It would have been good if, as insurers, records were checked from the Vets and THEN discussed recommended changes in the policy as we signed up so we knew, no surprises.  We found this out AFTER a claim was made which was denied.  Brilliant. We had a very negative experience with PetPlan, I would not recommend PetPlan.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"I literally feel like I have been scammed by Petplan. Short story: Every year you must do a wellness exam, which is not covered, and if they find anything wrong with your dog it is considered a pre-existing condition. Even if the previous exam she was fine. You have 0 chance at all to get reimbursed for anything that matter. Long story: I have been with them for more than 5 years since my dog was 6 months old. My dog being healthy, we only filled a claimed once 3-4 years ago without any issue at all. A month ago my dog seems to be a bit low on energy, doesn't eat at much as she used to, ect. Nothing too worrisome yet, but I decided to take her to the vet to check it out. They are not able to actually find anything clear, so they asked us to do further testing at a specialist vet. The only appointment available was a month later. During that time, my dog condition gets worse and worse, so 2 weeks later we must bring her to the emergency room. The hospital discovered that she has Addison diseases (which is a Congenital disorder). Since I was with Petplan for 5 years, and that I submitted claimed before without issue, I was certain they will cover this. Of course not, they told me that since she had not had a yearly wellness exam, they will use the first vet visit as the wellness exam. So I am thinking, no worries the first visit to the vet would be the wellness exam. That will not be reimbursed, but the visit to the hospital will be. Still not, since she had ""signs"" of it, then the entire episode is not cover. On top of that, they are telling me that now anything related to Addison diseases will not be covered in the future since the wellness exam is now the baseline. So they are considering my dog's diseases a PRE-EXISTING condition. I am with them for 5 years!!! I got insurance a month after getting our dog! How can this be a pre-existing condition? I failed to see how a yearly wellness exam would have detected Addison disease. Addison’s is difficult to trace and can not be detected at all thru a regular checkup. Only until there is a major crisis can vers even detect anything wrong And keep in mind that my dog had an exam when she left the shelter and I first got the insurance, it is not like they never had a baseline. The entire point to get an assurance so early on and paying a premium every year without ever using it was exactly to cover for this kind of issues. So basically every year you must do a wellness exam, which is not covered, and if they find anything wrong with your dog it is considered a pre-existing condition. Even if the previous exam was entirely fine. You have 0 chance at all to get reimbursed for anything that truly matters.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png
"Remember that pet plan is insurance. And they are a business. So while they don’t treat  pre-existing conditions and they do not treat health and wellness check ups. They definitely reimburse you when your pet is sick or has an emergency. My cat Mizu never had a problem until recently and it has been so nice knowing that I can get Mizu the best care and not have to worry financially. They have reimburse me 80% of all the money that I have spent at my vet.  Also,  I recommend getting pet insurance when your animal is little so that they do cover everything if something should arise.  And trust me, eventually it does.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopetplan.com,Petplan Pet Insurance,http://www.gopetplan.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/51986ab7000064000535b079/198x149.png

This was until I got bitten by a dog and had serious damage to my hand. WAG and the dog owners do not help pay for medical bills or any damages. On top of that, they do not require dog owners to disclose any important safety information about the dog..... when I asked if they could do that to protect people walking dogs they said they will NOT. That is EXTREMELY SKETCHY and I do not feel safe walking dogs now that they don't care about our well-being whats so ever. I understand not paying as a third party contractor.

"Wag is reliable about 75% of the time. Don't bother to schedule a walk on a Sunday morning, it will get canceled 14 times because their walkers sign up for walks, then stay out drunk on Saturday night, and cancel the Sunday morning walk. I've had walks scheduled for 8 am Sunday morning that didn't get filled until after 12 pm that day because of this, and it is like clockwork. Similarly, some of their walkers are unreliable and instead of doing some background work to fully service the customer's request, Wag will just cancel your walk and leave your dog unattended. Last weekend, I was in Puerto Rico and had a walker scheduled for 7 pm. He showed up, claimed he needed a code to get into my apartment, even though there is no code and there is a 24-hour concierge with a key, so Wag just canceled the walk. I then had to spend over 2 hours on and off the phone with them to get a walk rescheduled for my dog that didn't show up until 11:30 that night. This is not reliable service and no mom and pop business would be able to operate this way and stay in business. I will definitely be scaling my use of the service WAYYYYY back since this final straw. FYI, I've spent thousands of dollars on Wag, I prefer to spend my money at this point on a service I can rely on.",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/wagwalking.com,Wag!,https://wagwalking.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/57d7f8860000ff000594a726/0x0.png

"I've already written a review here, but if you want another, here, ya go -   The large blue bone is the only toy, of the innumerable ones I've provided to my pit/lab, that the dog cannot destroy.  Well, not for 6 months or so of chewing.  He's on his second one, when, after 7 months on the first one he managed to tear off a small piece off one of the knobs on the end.  I don't want him swallowing plastic stuff because he throws it up all over the bedroom. He demolished a Nyla-bone #10 in a day; ground it up into tiny pieces, swallowed them, threw them up...no joy. These toys are great for serious chewers.

"We tried some of Hackthedog’s products and we were thoroughly impressed. The shampoo has been excellent for the skin of my itch dogs, and has managed to keep up with everything from mud and sand to horse poo! The food went down a storm, from the second I opened the packet I had three pups performing every trick they know for my attention and a chance for a bite. As it’s freeze dried, limited ingredients and very low in carbs I’m confident it’s good even for my itchiest of pups.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hackthedog.com,Hackthedog,http://hackthedog.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5bf3cc70c7402600017347ae/198x149.png
"We tested the food a week ago and my boys loved it! We stired it with warm water and the boys cleaned every piece in their bowls 😅 We also love the cute little dogs on the packaging, maybe there is a way to pack it with paper instead of plastic but this just a little idea 😘 We feed our boys fresh and raw, and when we are on weekend adventures or journeys its always a problem what we should feed. But this food is ideal for travelers also cause its nearly has no weight. So if you are on a Trekkingtour and want to feed something good to your dog... Here you go! ❤️❤️❤️ If you want to see our boys, look on Instagram #raythemix",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hackthedog.com,Hackthedog,http://hackthedog.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5bf3cc70c7402600017347ae/198x149.png

"First off this shampoo is AMAZING. Yes it has a strong scent straight out of the bottle but afterwards there is NO fruity/floral scent, just a clean version of your animals scent (if that makes any sense?). I washed my dog twice with this shampoo but from now on only one round is needed since it lathers like expensive shampoos you'd get at a hair salon! This shampoo also helped loosen the excess undercoat and her Furminator brush went through like a sharp knife in butter. She is short/medium haired and it's always been mostly course/dry feeling with or without baths, after this bath her fur is thick and soft and not coarse/dry. Her skin looks AMAZING and the allergic reaction from the flea bites is gone, plus Sraige( eng. snail) isn't licking herself endlessly like she usually does after a bath",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hackthedog.com,Hackthedog,http://hackthedog.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5bf3cc70c7402600017347ae/198x149.png

Prices have doubled...selection is 1/10th what it used to be...the ONLY reason I bothered to place an order was the free shipping for $99 deal.

When I called to place my order that was quite large. The woman answering the phone was extremely rude and not helpful. She acted like I was doing her a favor by ordering supplies.

I'm going on my second pack as I bought the medium while my dog was still growing & now getting the large.  I purchased it for long walks/hikes - but it's also been super useful for carrying her in the airport before boarding.  People are pretty amazed seeing the dog in the backpack.  I've tried several other packs & this is by far the best made & sturdiest.

I sent a second email on Nov 28 inquiring the same thing.  No response.  On Dec 2, I logged into my PayPal account to try & contact them that way.

I have been ordering for a few years from these people and had one bad experience but gave them another try. In October I made an order and they got the money through PayPal but never shipped my items. I could not reach them by telephone and they did not reply to my emails. I got a call from one of their suppliers and was told by them that they owed them a lot of money and never paid. I filed a dispute through PayPal and got my money back. I assume they are out of business. They took people's money under false pretenses then absconded with whatever money they could. I will continue to buy from Chewy.com and Amazon.

"I got the whistle with high hopes and looked forward to utilizing it with my puppy, Ruby while I was away at work during the week. Within the first week, my whistle had broken and luckily since they have the 30 day trial period, I was able to get a replacement. But not without searching the internet and contacting them multiple times via phone, online chat, and email.. after about two days I finally managed to reach someone and get things resolved. I then started noticing that the whistle was logging my drive time with her as activity. When I reached out to support they were not helpful in the slightest and brushed it off. Finally I came to the conclusion that I just needed to return it since it wasn’t quite what we were expecting. The gal I spoke to over the phone put me on hold five times and seemed extremely confused the whole time we were talking.

No email confirmation of order. No status of delivery provided.

At the time of my order of new equipment, (accomplished to meet the discount deadline) I sent an email to Whistle asking that they hold my order until further notice. I was away from home and did not want the equipment to sit in my Rural Route mailbox out on the public road for several days. Apparently my email (which included my order number) went unnoticed, as the equipment was shipped immediately.  Fortunately, it was still in my mailbox, unharmed, when I arrived home a week after shipping.  I hope you will be able to do better in the future. On a brighter note, I very much appreciate the 40% discount.

"When I ordered this product online it gave me the option to have it shipped by USPS free of charge, or for an additional 15 dollars have it shipped by UPS. I choose to have it shipped by UPS because USPS will not deliver directly to my physical address (SC). I was excited to receive this product within 2 days. (because the prior week, my dog was missing for 24 hours) As I followed up on the product, it turned out that it was shipped by USPS instead of UPS. Not only did it take a day extra to arrive here, but it arrived at the local post office and they decided to ship it back to the carrier (out in CA). It has been 8 days since I have ordered this product and I am still waiting on my product. When I called customer service, I was told I will be getting a full refund of the product, including the shipping cost, but when I called back and spoke to a different colleague (Shahzabi), I was told that I will only get a free refund of the $15 shipping cost.

I tried to purchase a replacement “rubber” whistle 3 collar attachments... the website listed the collar attachments as “available in 2 weeks”. I returned in 2 weeks and purchased the “1 X WHISTLE 3 – ADDITIONAL SNAP COLLAR ATTACHMENTS” only to find they are no longer made of rubber and do not fit my dog’s collar securely. The new clasp locks tightly on to the collar but the whistle no longer locks securely to the new clasp making it easy for the whistle to fall off.  The clasp requires a lot of fidgeting to get the whistle to lock on. I LOVE my WHISTLE 3 and the security it gave me. This “One Size Fits All” plastic collar clasp is not a good solution for my dog. Now I am insecure about my dog‘s safety again.  I will try to 3D print something that works better. Be prepared for this clasp to give you problems or not work at all on a large breed cotton dog collar. It seems that the collar’s cotton material prevents the clasp spring mechanism from closing properly. I wish the rubber clasps were still available.,2,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/whistle.com,Whistle,https://www.whistle.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/57eedc990000ff0005956a3c/0x0.png

Flea Battle I have been battling fleas all spring and was at my wits end. Decided to look for natural products to help since all other methods failed. I found Vetionx through my doggie daycare where my dog attends and ordered the Defendex Red. What a game changer. It has worked. I also use the cedar guard. My daughter is actually allergic to cedar so I was a little nervous but red the FAQ's and realized its cedar oil not the pollen. So she has had no problems.

I purchased this pain reliever in hopes that it would help my 15 1/2 yr heeler mix with pain of arthritis.   The vet had changed her pain meds and it wasn't working really well.   On a single dose a day.  It gave her no relief.   So I doubled the dosage to am and pm.   I used the recommended dose of 3/4 tsp.   I had to mix it with a small amount of can dog food or she wouldn't take it.   It helped some but did not give the relief of her original pain meds of carprophen.   So I went to another vet and he recommended that I put her back on that.   At this point in her treatment... it is necessary to keep her comfortable.    This probably would help with a younger dog with less problems.,3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.vetionx.com,VETiONX,https://www.vetionx.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/4d80f8c100006400050f1e26/0x0.png

"I was expecting more for ~$30 socks. I'm not a fan of the material the socks are made out of. The stitching was also ""off"" on my socks and the heel of the stitching came to the front of the sock too. I ended up getting a refund on my socks but I'm disappointed that the quality was so subpar to begin with. For the record, the socks themselves are made in China -- only the printing is done in the USA... so their advertising is a bit deceitful in that way. Not that it matters since 90% of what we have in the US is made elsewhere but I find the deceit in the company's advertising a bit problematic.",2,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopupsocks.com,PupSocks,http://gopupsocks.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5a3834bdb894c90c9023c99b/0x0.png

On July 29, I received a voicemail from you stating that the product was back ordered and would not ship till around August 1, and did still want the order, I said yes. So that suggests that you didn’t know the cat food was back ordered from July 22 when you receive the order until July 29, when you call me? Seven days without any communications about the order is unacceptable. Knowing we would not have enough food to last until maybe August 2nd or third, on July 29 I placed an order for cat food from Chewy.com, within about two hours I received an email from Chewy.com stating that the order has shipped.

"The level of terrible customer service where the pharmacy is concerned is astounding to me. I have been using KV vet supply for awhile now, due to their very fair price point on medications. However EVERY SINGLE TIME I have had to place an order, I have to call to get updates. Either they don't contact my vet at all, contact the wrong vet or this last just cancel an order for Vetmedin all together and not notify me. Having three dogs with CHF, I need a pharmacy that is more reliable than this and for the final time KV Vet supply has proven to me they just are NOT reliable.

"I run a non profit rescue/adoption organization and needed a medication for one of our foster animals. I found the product and then had to call customer service to get our non profit status approved so we wouldn't be charged tax. Justine, the customer service rep, told me to send our 501 c 3. There is no such document. We received our Letter of Determination when we were approved by the IRS in 1997. It's the only document that unequivocally shows our non profit status. I don't remember how long it took for her to inform me that I sent the wrong document. What's more important than our federal paperwork? They wanted a document from the state. So I sent the Cert 119 which is the state approved form to use to make purchases with all merchants in my state. They didn't want that either. They wanted the W9 form which is just a *request* to the IRS for our tax payer number. I sent that form days ago and haven't heard back. Meanwhile, I've had to go elsewhere for our foster dog's medication. I will NEVER shop here. Again, the worst customer service ever, particularly since this was urgent, we needed a prescribed medication by our dog's veterinarian for Cushing's Disease. Absolutely no sense of urgency on Justine's part. She and KV Supply get a 0. This site won't post the review unless I provide a rating.

"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I had my vet fax them the prescription for Proin and Bravecto, and my first order was filled and shipped.  When it was time for a refill, I ordered early enough so we wouldn't run out.  Got an email  about a week after I placed the order saying there would be a slight delay because the pharmacy was being redone and updated.  So I went to my vet and got the meds.  Then, they changed the status of my order to say ""This item will process and ship after Prescriptions are approved. All prescriptions will not be fulfilled until approved by your veterinarian.""  I called and spoke with a lady who tried to tell me the order showed shipped and when I told her no, it showed pending, she said she would check into it and call me back.  Never happened.

"In 2018 I placed three orders with KV Supply. Two of those orders were badly managed that resulted in my dogs having to go without their medicine, one was for a heart condition and the other for arthritis, for a number of days. The latest order issues were that one of the medicines was on backorder and the other they couldn't locate the authorization which had been faxed to them. I wasn't informed of either of these issues until after checking online and seeing that the order status noted that it had been shipped 9 days prior. When I called to inform them I had not received the order, I was informed about the backorder and lack of authorization. When dealing with medicines related to serious health issues of my pets, this is totally unacceptable and irresponsible conduct of a company purporting to be trustworthy and professional.

"Absolutely rubbish. I bought this a week ago from Petbarn in Australia. At first it was working okay. The live stream quality was really bad, like watching something with dial up internet, nothing but slow motion pixels moving across my screen which constantly had blurry colours interferring. Our internet connection is fantastic and we have never had an issue in the past, as we stream netflix daily. The 4 and 5 second clips were recorded with great quality but it would record EVERYTHING even when there was absolutely no sound or movement. Do you know how annoying it is having to individually delete 4 second clips that are recorded ALL DAY? I decided to upgrade to the optimal package which cost me $48USD as it promised to give me 30 second clips. Well well, much to my surprise it is STILL recording 4 and 5 second clips, no 30 second clips in sight. And to top it off, today, I haven't been able to log in all day as it keeps saying 'timeout' or 'data synchronization fail'. I am angry I wasted $200AUD to buy this stupid device, and then a further $48USD to 'upgrade' to what appears to be the worst product I've ever bought.

"Had this about a month so far. Immediately noticed it didnt come with the bag of treats it was supposed to. No big deal. I had some on hand and I fire off an email. It was late on a Friday so I didnt expect to hear back before Monday. Stuff gets forgotten in packaging, it happens.  I signed up for the Petcare and was getting push notifications non stop. Check the account and notice it is constantly uploading videos even when no one (including the dog) were home. Watch one of the +60 video recorded past midnight and notice some sort of electrical interference the mic was picking up. So I fire off another email and turn off noise recording and push notifications (negating the entire reason I signed up for the $30 petcare). Sent the second email Saturday, day after first email, and again expect to hear something by Monday. Fast forward a week and still havent hear back from my emails. Ok, I'll call them. Sat on hold for 5 minutes and got the option for them to call back once someone is available. I opt for that. Now, 10 days later, still no call back. Still no return email. Still no items that were supposed to be in the box. Still no resolution on electrical noise. If customer service sucked but it worked as advertised, I'm good. If it didnt work but customer service was trying to fix it, I'm good. But right now, it can do part of what is advertised and I get ghosted by CS.

"If there were more than 5 stars, Ruidoso Malinois would get them! I am beyond pleased with my decision to purchase a trained dog from Ruidoso Malinois. And my dog—beyond my wildest expectations! He is wonderful, fulfilling his role as protector with absolute confidence, and is incredibly smart.

"Before I begin my review of Ruidoso Malinois, I think it appropriate to  provide a brief description of myself. I am a 62 year old whom is OCD about my dogs. I am a former police K9 Handler and been exposed to hundreds of police dogs from all over the country. I have attended several formal dog training programs and I am very focused and particular when I select a dog. Before I ended my search for a Malinois puppy, I traveled the country, via automobile, and visited several popular Malinois breeders. Prior to reaching Ruidoso Malinois, I contacted several law-enforcement agencies in the area and completed a brief background investigation of the establishment and its owner. I discovered that both are respected members of the community. After I arrived at Ruidoso Malinois, the owner Irene provided me a tour of the facility. I immediately noticed the approximately 70 dogs/puppies were housed in clean extremely organized kennels. I also observed several older “retired” dogs on the property that were inside a large dog run. Irene told me that the older dogs are living the rest of their lives in luxury. Irene also pointed to an older dog whose breed I cannot remember, that was allowed to run around another large dog run. I do not remember the specifics of the story, but Irene said she adopted the dog and was taking care of it at great expense. It soon became evident Irene is not only a dog breeder, she has compassion for the animals as well. During several lengthy conversations, Irene displayed vast knowledge about Malinois and their care. Everything I observed was far and above things I observed at other kennels I visited. I drove home with a 16 week old Ruidoso Malinois puppy. A few weeks ago after a blood test administered to the puppy indicated health concerns, I contact Irene and she was very responsive and helpful. She told me that she would have her veterinarian examine the test results and get back to me. The following day I took the puppy to a different veterinarian and had another blood sample withdrawn. Thankfully, the results of the second blood test revealed a healthy puppy. Often time when I am observed working my pup, people ask where I got him. My pup recently turned 12 months old and he is smart, balanced and possesses all drives necessary to be a great working dog. I am the weak link in the partnership. I think highly of Irene and the dogs that are produced at her facility.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
"The rating is for Ruidoso Malinois where I have purchased three Malinois over the course of 9 years. I will discuss my experiences via a separate review. However, the following is directed @Truthseeker882 (TS) whose comments about heartworm are baseless. TS apparently does not know much about canine epidemiology, in particular that regarding heartworm, and how to look up, review and understand the heartworm prevalence map of the US. With respect to where I live in Mohave County AZ and the location of Ruidoso Malinois in Lincoln County NM, the incidence rate for heartworm is 0.2% (3 cases in 2019) and 0% (0 cases in 2019) respectively. Since the parasite is transmitted by mosquitoes and is more prevalent in wetter environments, it's statistically reasonable, per the aforementioned map, to state that if you purchased a puppy from Ruidoso Malinois and at an annual wellness check, months after receipt of the puppy, a heartworm infection is detected, don't imply blame to Ruidoso Malinois but check where you live. Also, note in the Ruidoso Malinois purchase agreement there is a specific recommendation to have a wellness check within 30 days of purchase. Therefore, TS, it's one thing to reasonably discuss a potential concern but quite another to spread false information/implications about someone's character and business.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png

"Got my puppy a few days ago! He came via American Airlines , he came in a brand new cage that was mine to keep. He was sent with his food and water accessible to him in the cage. He was hyper out of the cage as any pup would be after 2 flights (connecting to Pittsburgh)! We immediately bonded per Irene’s recommendations on our greeting. We’ve bonded approximately 3 days now and he follows me everywhere , doesn’t even need a leash (He hates his leash anyway haha). I must say Irene picked the perfect puppy as a K9 candidate for me and my department. His personality is perfect for an amazing working dog. You can tell she cares about the pups because of his amazing confidence, grooming , and general health upon further observation the last few days. I would highly recommend Irene and company to anyone looking for a good puppy. I can’t speak on the training from experience , but if she runs her training anything like the puppies, I’d trust it! I remember reading several people having issues, but the issues were things that to me appeared people lacked patience. I blew Irene up all the time she probably wanted to throw her phone! Haha, but she didn’t , she responded to me in a timely manner , never blew me off , and just kept me up to date with pictures, information on his well being , and knowledge of how to prepare for him. I hope that Gideon can be a standard and a demonstration for others in my area as a place to take there business when it comes to getting Police K9s, because hands down I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

While we haven't met Irene in person yet, she has been helpful considering her very busy schedule. And she has staff members who are knowledgeable and helpful. Thank you, Irene and staff. There is one thing that we didn't expect -- our Malinois pup apparently carries recessive genes that have resulted in a Belgian Shepard with long, relatively thin hair. Also, much of his coat is darkening to sable or black, but his hindquarters remain fawn. No one we have met so far thinks he is Malinois, which can be irritating. Appearance aside, the dog we bought from Ruidoso Malinois is intelligent, protective, curious and he learns commands easily. Again, thank you, Irene. Oh, another aside, when we went to pick up our puppy, the all of the outdoor puppy pens were spotless and there were no flies or other insects to be found. Caring for so many animals is hard, sometimes thankless work and so another thank you. Best, Robert C Brown and Barbara Staley Brown",4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
"We purchased a 2-year-old female dog from Ruidoso almost three months ago, and we could not be more thrilled with our new life.  Our family of four traveled to New Mexico and were trained on property, two sessions per day for our five-day handlers training. Many different options for skills were presented.  We were able to discuss and select the skills important to our family, and she was trained for around 10 weeks on only those commands we agreed upon.  That is the business side of things. It has been surprising to me how attached our family has gotten to our dog.  She has brought our family a ton of joy, as well as security.  She is wicked smart – I swear she has telepathy. That being said, Ruidoso Malinois not only perfectly found the right dog for our circumstance, but they also delivered upon their promise to train and provide an extremely well-trained dog. Irene and her staff truly love the breed.  They made us feel safe and welcome, considering the stress of training to handle and maintain a protective canine. We have owned many different breeds of dogs – English Mastiff, Labrador, Weimaraner, Beagle, Pug, and Dachshaund.  There are only two things to say about Ruidoso Malinois.  I will never purchase any other breed of dog other than a Belgium Malinois.  I will never purchase another Belgium Malinois from anyone but the best . . . and the best is Ruidoso. Our family gives Ruidoso a ten out of ten stars.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
"Our entire experience, from meeting Irene Howcroft, visiting her Ruidoso Malinois kennel, and purchasing our Tara, was exceptional! First, Irene and I spoke multiple times before we decided to travel out to meet her and Tara. We wanted a trained dog and luckily Irene had a perfect two year old for us.  I had done a lot of research, and Irene’s knowledge of the breed was outstanding... it totally set her apart! We were so impressed with the kennels, staff, and facilities at Ruidoso Malinois! Irene took time to throughly describe the background of the breed and explained in detail the requirements that owning a Belgian Malinois would entail. Irene invests her heart and soul in her dogs and she wants them all to have the very best life. My daughter instantly fell in love with Tara and the feeling was mutual! We returned six weeks later for training and Tara has been a wonderful addition to our family ever since! Honestly, we have never seen a dog bond with a person as quickly as Tara did with my daughter! From day one she was her girl! Irene and I have kept in touch and she is truly one of the most kind hearted dog lovers I have ever met! If I could... I would give Irene a million stars! Irene Howcroft is an expert and we would highly recommend anyone considering adding a Belgian Malinois to their family to contact Irene and visit her kennel! We could not be happier with our entire experience with Irene and our Tara is everything we hoped for and more!",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
i have poor time with this woman for a dog. she was bad and never good when we want dog much rude,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
"First of all, I would like to state that I have had a wonderful experience in purchasing my beautiful Lucianna from Irene / Ruidoso Malinois. I have owned a Malinois Family Protection Dog in the past but found my experience with her kennel to be far superior. I first began speaking with Irene about a dog in October 2018 and was amazed at her knowledge, willingness to take the time to fully answer my endless questions, and caring to kindly respond to my more ignorant moments. Over the months I have spoken with many client references from people who have purchased both puppies as well as fully trained Protection & Working dogs. The response from the people I spoke with was universally “over the moon” with their “members of the family” or in the case of working dogs, their Partner. I have had the opportunity to visit the Ruidoso facility on several occasions. The first was to meet and feel comfortable with the kennel and on the second occasion to go through the 5 day handler training that comes with every protection dog. The kennel was extremely clean, well maintained and healthy, and great for raising and training dogs and puppies.  Puppies are initially raised in the house with Irene, and at 10 weeks the puppies have their 2nd set of inoculations and move outside to big group pens so they can experience the outside while being located just outside the front door so they have close supervision by Irene and her staff. The adult dogs have outside pens (many bigger than my backyard!). The business aspects of the purchase of my dog were very clearly stated with regard to both the non-transfer of breeding rights and health warranties and workability of my dog. I was given copies of all X-rays and health certificates of Lucianna. I understood the breeding restrictions as I do not support the “backyard” breeding of these top bloodlines either. Great care should be taken to preserve and protect dogs of this quality and capability. In my view, all aspects of the “business side” of the transaction were straightforward, clear and in all aspects, transparent. Simple. In summary, I feel fortunate to have found Ruidoso Malinois, have been able to learn from Irene and most importantly to have found Lucianna, a wonderful protection companion to spend my future years loving. Secondly,….. I find several aspects of the negative communications on the Ruidioso Malinois Facebook page and Trust Pilot review to be very sad. First and foremost is the death of a well loved dog. I think we can all understand Mr Pancroft’s  grief. Secondly, I find Mr Pancroft’s focus on Ruidoso Malinois  to vent his grief sad as well. This is clearly the result of vindictive intent. I have studied the communications between his troll (Ani Austin) on the Ruidoso Facebook page as well as the numerous edits he has been making to his negative review (making it more and more negative with each edit) on Trustpilot and find them to be a clear and concerted effort to demean the reputation of a quality breeder and trainer that has provided so many dogs that have brought such joy and/or protection to many families and people. To readers of this message, if you have any doubts about Ruidoso, either review the facebook communications or simply call Irene at Ruidoso and talk to her. Also, review the Ruidoso Malinois Website. It is very informative and transparent with regard to all aspects of it’s business as well as the Malinois breed. Andrew is an ex employee / consultant to Ruidoso who seems to have an axe to grind. As an “imagine & reputation” expert consultant on the internet, it would seem that he is simply using his skills to attack Ruidoso Malinois. To Andrew, this is becoming silly and mean spirited. I doubt this is who you are trying to be. Lets all love your dog, and wish you the all the best with your new/future family member. To end this review, I would just like to state how happy I am to be working with Ruidoso Malinois, in fact while at my Handler’s school I fell in love with another puppy. I may well end up with TWO dogs by the middle of this summer.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
Great facility!  Conditions for working dog housing could not be better. Well thought out kennels in an open mountain air setting. Gorgeous dogs!  Irene knows her stuff!

"For anyone who is wanting to get a Belgian Malinois I full recommend Ruidoso Malinois and Irene. I have a German Shephard that I bought hoping he would be a good service dog for me because of my PTSD and anxiety, I recently had to retire him due to his anxiety with being in crowded places. Because of my anxiety and what I have been through its hard for me to go out and not feel terrified. After finding Irene and her kennel online and talking with other people who have the breed I was excited to get the call back from Irene. After telling her about my family and what I have been through she told me she had the perfect Belgian for me, and she was right. My fiancée and I made the drive to her kennel from Utah and when we got there we were greeted by one of her trainers and a couple of her puppies. I was nervous because the only dog I have ever had a strong bond with was my great pyreneese. I was hoping to have that same bond with the female she picked for me. When I met ketty it was love at first sight and she new that she had found her family. Words can not describe the connection we have. Irene was right when she said she had the perfect dog for me. I pick ketty up next month and I can not wait to have her home. Irene has kept me posted on her progress and sends me pictures of her weekly. Again I fully recommend Irene and her kennel for anyone looking at getting a Belgian malinois.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png
"Where to begin...first...we purchased our boy from this breeder. The experience with the breeder notwithstanding, we could not have asked for a better dog! He was the most loyal and just absolutely biggest joy of our life! Recently, at just over two years old, we unexpectedly lost our boy, we are absolutely devastated!!! I am trying my best to live my life in honor of our boy and be the person he always believed me to be. That said, I feel it important to share our experience with this breeder. After having provided a deposit, I arrived to pick up our boy. This was our first foray into dogs and after having gotten our pup, people we ended up meeting informed us of concerns with a Ruidoso Malinois. Aside from the litany of negative online reviews, more about the breeder than the dogs, we were told that a legit Malinois breeder would have never given us a dog without having ever met us, learned of our lifestyle, housing and work arrangements. It is now my understanding that these are areas a legitimate breeder would have interest so that the dog doesn’t end up in a bad environment, abused or in a shelter! You will likely discover, as she seems to have a history of doing, a sudden increase in positive reviews on this and other pages reviewing Ruidoso Malinois. Kudos for her ability to rally the troops to attempt to push down the negative experience(s) of those she has injured. She DEF is savvy and posses skills in this regard!! But, end of the day, none of these people have any idea of what our experience was with this breeder, aside from the clipped and edited texts she’s seen fit to post. But, again, kudos to her for pulling them together to bash us and our post based solely on her request! If they wish to post their experience, that’s great. But, to assume they know our experience...meh At any rate, I arrived to pick up our boy, video in hand to record the exciting event, as most people do these days! I was approximately 30 minutes early and was approached by a VERY dirty, nice, but VERY dirty young girl wearing hip waders stained to the knees with dog crap. She told me the breeder refused to come out and meet me because I was early - after driving from Denver, I just wanted to conduct my business and get on the road home. Well, I received a number of texts messages, followed by a call from the breeder and as she went on a tirade asking why I was early, she accused me of trying to spy on her...paranoid much? Given her attitude, I told her that I would be happy to just accept a refund and be on my way. She advised me there are no refunds and I ""Have to accept my dog or forfeit deposit"". Once I returned, upon arriving at the breeders house, I was overwhelmed with the pungent smell of dog poo!!! Walking up the short dirt drive, I passed three makeshift wire fence pens, each circling a tree and each containing a single dog going pretty much batshit crazy, as I have since learned Malinois do when they are penned up with no attention. There was also an out building about 50 yards from the house which seemed to house 20 or so barking adult dogs, the pens seemed to be...""overflow"". As I approached the house, I found another three makeshift pens, which contained a number of pups living or at least in dirt and poo, old, dirty toys, etc. In total, there were probably 40-60 pups on the ground. At the time, being new to the dog world, I thought this to be the norm. I've since been told...not so much. What we've described to other breeders, and showing them the video I took when picking up our boy, we're told these conditions are ""Deplorable"" and, ""The epitome of a puppy mill"". Fast forward to our dog's second year...he was titled as per our contract and we inquired about breeding. We were put off, made promises, all of which were never followed thru on. Last brush-off would have been in Nov. '18 when she advised she would reply in a week due to out-of-town family. Never heard back, even after reaching out! After having lost our boy, reputable breeders we spoke with suggested that the breeder of our dog may have known he had potential health issues, which could explain why she refused to allow us any breeding rights - she also failed to provide us with health certs of the sire or dam, which I am told is a HUGE red flag! Irene Howcroft has been pretty ugly this entire time! She has responded to others who have made negative posts about her by randomly blasting their employer (attempting to jeopardize their employment by doing so, then claiming THEY are seeking revenge against her!!??) and personal phone number(s) of those who have posted negatively about Ruidoso Malinois. Without fail, she refers to everyone as a liar and suggests there is some conspiracy against her. Always posting some protracted reply making note of how stellar her business is, but fails to touch on the points where she is deficient - there are a number! You will also find that she has an astonishing number of positive reviews after any negative review(s) as she does rally friends to post and attack those who post negative experience(s). And while these people may have had good experience, this doesn’t make others poor experience any less valid or relevant!! The internal struggle I suffer with is NOT having been able to breed our boy, but did she know of health issues that we may have been able to address and perhaps extend the life of this majestic creature!? The vet initially suggested that he may have suffered a heart attack, but the vet who performed the necropsy informed us that at leas than three years old and 50 ft from the car on a walk in the park, something, “more sinister” is likely. And, in fact a congenital disorder was found. If you research, you will find a court matter related to this breeder. And, while the case(s) was/were indeed ""dropped"" it wasn't that there was a prevailing trial, but that the municipal offices that conducted this enforcement operated outside of their jurisdiction, literally by approx. 100 yards! She was awarded damages due to the authorities operating outside of their jurisdiction...there was nothing indicating their accusations were untrue. In fact, our dog had worms and giardia when he went to the vet the day we got him home - you can discover online about her dogs being seized and her response to the accusation(s) of her dogs health. She acknowledges her dogs were indeed in treatment for giardia. I was told that dogs in treatment should not leave the breeder so as to prevent infecting other dogs as well as ensuring the dogs are in good health prior to being homes - again, our dog came to us with giardia and worms. In all fairness, I have again been advised worms can be pretty normal with pups. The breeder also claims that is normal with all puppies...perhaps. But, neither of our dogs since came to us with either affliction! Also, the people who this breeder sued and ""prevailed"" were all pretty much those who worked for her, at one time or another, for Minimum wage. They failed to respond as most of them were/are unable to afford counsel...the cases were pretty much all default/fail to answer the complaint...people were unable to afford counsel to answer the suit. This breeder advised us that her seizure of her dogs cost her a contract of 160 dogs to the State of New Mexico (Her claim in an online news article) and probably another 200 sales of dogs, all to have happened in a single year...360 dogs in a year??? You do the math!! We currently struggle with the decision to bring another dog into our family, but have spoken with a number of breeders and have decided that we are a good family and that we provide a great life for our four-legged family members - each had something negative to say about Ruidoso Malinois! And, while I understand people have grudges or whatever, if a number of people all seem to suggest similar problems with this breeder, there must to some validity with their claims!? So, while our lost boy was wonderful in EVERY way, we do not attribute any of that to this breeder! She will claim how she spent so much time choosing the right dog for us, she never met us and asked minimal questions of us. Each dog since, we've had to complete an evaluation for suitability. We miss him terribly and hope nobody ever has to experience what we have, witnessing this young and beautiful creature...our beloved family member take his last breath at such a young age!! End of the day...if there are enough people making negative assertions, it’s likely at least some of them are true. This woman calls everyone a liar or likely a jealous competitor! Why take a chance with a puppy mill, with a negative history when there are so many reputable breeders which have 100% positive reviews and flawless history!!!",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ruidosomalinois.com,Ruidoso Malinois,http://www.ruidosomalinois.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/59c6283b0000ff0005abd6c1/198x149.png

She sells to municipalities, state, and federal governments and qualified individuals. Don't be fooled by puppy mills or private breeders. Her dogs are the BEST of the BEST and Malinois's are the greatest dogs on earth. Ask any police officer, soldier or professional trainer. Great dogs from a great kennel that deals in Mali's ONLY!

Do not purchase through Petbucket.com they take extra money out of the account you charge with and then claim they have no idea what you're talking about. I physically see the unauthorized charge on my bank statement. Also I never even received the product after a month I demanded a full refund and of course they won't return the extra money they charged 4/16/19 after the authorized flea treatment charge. My bank is filling a fraudulent charge! Buy products for your pets at your local vet offices to avoid the extra bs by only spending a few bucks more.,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/petbucket.com,Pet Bucket,https://www.petbucket.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5bfcc9c37dde9300014d4b96/198x149.png

"I guess I'll be the first to comment on this. I have ordered a product from this place now two times. Revolution Brown Dogs 10-20lbs (5-10kg) - 6 Pack @ $60.95. This is a good price considering where I""m from its around $20 a tube. So it does save me some money. The product also seems to work really well. The only complaint I have is that when you order it from the United States it takes forever to receive it because it is all the way in the United Kingdom. It gets shipped out in about 3 business day's but, its been two weeks and I still haven't received it. It could take up to 4 weeks (20 business days).

I have purchased three bottles and almost used the last Lumen Pro Advanced Lanosterol Solution on my dog's cataracts I can't see much improvement though there is some. I had hoped from other users reviews to get the same great result. In this product's defence I will say when I was on holiday for 3 weeks I didn't put in drops as often as stated by company so am going to try another bottle and use precisely as stated. The service from this company is good but only giving three stars so far for the product.,3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/heliostatix.org,Heliostatix,http://heliostatix.org?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5c9a3b509bfecb0001ed5b57/198x149.png

"I am in Australia and the shipped estimate was 4-6 weeks. I received it within 10 days. I am testing it on my Lhasa Apso Nugget (Nuggybug) he is blind in one eye and the other eye is showing signs of deterioration. Nuggy has always been very playful and he still loves playtime so I have had to opt for toys that are odd shaped, brightly coloured and will make a noise so he can follow where it is.

"So I get why the drops have to be so thick and sticky but despite my careful delivery and a very manageable small dog, before I even flip the bottle to deliver the drops, my hand is covered in the fluid. After the first dose I realized 2 drops was too much for my dog's little eyes and just wasteful, so I immediately switched to just 1 drop per eye/twice a day. Just over 2 weeks into treatment and the bottle is empty???!!! Already costs so much in Canadian $. Is it a faulty bottle? I really want to continue and give the drops a chance but if this is the deal then theres no way I can afford to. I hope it's just a bad bottle and the company can rectify this for me so I can continue and hopefully improve my 6 year old girl's sight",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/heliostatix.org,Heliostatix,http://heliostatix.org?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5c9a3b509bfecb0001ed5b57/198x149.png

"My opinion is based on my experience only, yours (hopefully) may be different. I treated my 8yo Springer Spaniel after he became diabetic in Feb. 2019 and blind overnight a month later. I didn't see any change after using 2 bottles, 3 drops per eye twice daily. I don't know if more drops or longer treatment would have helped. He did not allow application without bribery treats.

"I have a border collie (Logan age 8) and a terrier mix (Smokey age 9), over the years I’ve noticed Logan’s coat getting lighter and he started to have hip problems, nothing drastic, after a long day he would have trouble walking or standing. I ordered the treats, calming spray, and dry shampoo to test everything out my dogs go crazy over the BACON flavored calming spray, the treats as well. I have yet to use the dry shampoo, I’ll update later on that. After about 1-2 weeks. I would wake up with Logan on my bed, (about 3-4 ft above the ground. Didn’t think much, expcept “get off my bed it’s too early” then I realized he hadn’t done it in awhile. I noticed Logan’s energy levels started improving along with his coat and mobility. It blew my wife and I away, we couldn’t believe it. We were accepting the fact that he was getting old, now we are beyond excited that he is able to enjoy the active life style for a little while longer. Seriously, this stuff works great for our kids (dogs)",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/zenpup.co,Zenpup,http://zenpup.co?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5c213175a9c24e0001475b48/0x0.png
My dog Mary has been showing signs of arthritis and joint pain over the last 6 months. The vet informed me that it was just really bad arthritis. My friend recommended zenpup to me and I was able to avoid all prescription meds. My dog has been using the pet treats and oral spray tinctures for the past 2 weeks and I have seen a significant difference in her performance. I honestly love zenpup and I can’t wait till they come out with more products for my dog. The dry shampoo is also amazing/ I like to use it when I don’t have time to give my dog a bath.

"The bath is awesome. I really like it, and my dog likes it. However, it does leak between the tub and the hose, no matter what I do to stop it. so I have to have a tub underneath it so the drip doesn't ruin my floor. Well, it's more than a drip. The thread needs to be deeper on the hose to prevent this oh, I think. Other than that, it's a great product.",4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.boosterbath.com,Booster Bath,http://www.boosterbath.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5cdec1fb86b3c4000191b671/198x149.png

"My girls (35lb and 100lb) tolerate, but don't like being bathed in the shower. And they are way too big for a tub or sink or anything like that. So when I came across the booster bath, it was a ""dream"" product for me. I purchased mine 22 months prior to the writing of this review and, upon receiving it, genuinely loved it. And although the girls didn't really love being bathed in the booster bath either, it seemed to be a huge improvement in their eyes, as it certainly was in mine! No more leaning down for an hour to finish with back pain. No more wet dogs running around my bedroom after a bath. And cleaner dogs overall - with them elevated and tethered at waist height, I was much more easily able to clean their bellies, heads and necks, and leave conditioner in for the recommended time instead of rushing to get them out of the shower. On the whole, I was a very happy camper. But after each bath, the leash restraints seemed to get more fragile and weathered. I imagine this is because they are left wet after each bath, though I don't really know. All I knew for sure is that they would break sooner rather than later - and after the 21st month, they did. No biggie, I figured. I'll order a new one. I knew it would be out of warranty, but it seemed fine, since I loved the product so much. I had a little trouble figuring out where to order, and after a while I sent an email to Booster Bath customer service. They responded first thing the next morning, another good sign. Then the problem cropped up: you cannot actually order just a leash restraint. You must order the entire parts bag! This meant I had to pay $36 for a single broken strap - about 25% of what I paid for the product, and an order that from my experience so far is likely to placed every year and a half to two years. It also means a ton of material waste - I'll be throwing out everything in the bag except the leash restraint. So essentially, you have a great product and responsive customer service, but a product that will regularly break and require expensive replacement parts, plus material waste, and a generally flawed customer service policy. I'd give the product's functionality like 6*. Customer service response time is 4* (my second email took 2 days to receive an answer). But durability is 3*, and replacement part cost is zero stars (again, $36 for a single 12 inch length of cloth is downright abusive!). Average it out, you get a 3* product.",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.boosterbath.com,Booster Bath,http://www.boosterbath.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5cdec1fb86b3c4000191b671/198x149.png

"I just wanted to say thank you for a miracle product. I have a 117 lb Labrador names Champ, who has always had hip issues. We never wanted to have surgery because I have heard horror stories about the long term results. He is now 11 years old and about six month ago he was not able to get up off of his bed to eat. He also could not walk on the wooden floors and was basically bound to his dog bed. We could also see he was in a tremendous amount of pain. We tried powered Glucosamine, which initially seems to help a bit, but not enough that he could get up. We were really talking about having to put him out of his misery. I found your product online, and I was began to see that he was better. Each week he improved greatly, and now after six weeks of administering Chondropaw, Champ can now go for short walks around the block, and we can see that the pain has subsided.

"I purchased some clothes for my dog on chewy.com and they charged me for the full order.

When they admitted that they saw the additional charges. I would say that's a lot of inconvenience for something that was a error on their part. It's a lot of hold time with the bank and with them. It's a  terrible business practice and for that I will never order anything else from them.

I ordered a dog dematting comb.  It arrived & I hated it.  I left a review on Chewy.com on the product & the next day Chewy contacted me privately & apologized for my experience.  They even offered me a refund & told me to give the comb to a shelter.  I never asked for a refund.  They offered it.  I switched to chewy from Petco & I am so glad that I did!!,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/chewy.com,Chewy.com,http://www.chewy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/504782b500006400051ad6fc/198x149.png

"Chewy customer service is amazing, they are so caring and thoughtful. I had ordered some glucosamine tablets on Friday, my best bud of 12 years passed on Sunday.  I emailed them Monday saying I wouldn't need the tablets, they responded in less than an hour, saying they would refund my money, and I should donate to a doggy in need.

"I would like to thank Chewy for going above and beyond for my mom and her kitty Joey.  Joey was on a specialized diet for kidney and liver problems.  Sadly, Joey crossed the Rainbow Bridge on Tuesday, October 22, 2019.  Later the same day, his special food was delivered as previously scheduled. Chewy refunded the purchase and did not ask for the product to be returned; she can now donate the special food to other special kitties at a shelter or veterinarian of her choosing. But wait - There's more!  Today, my mom received a beautiful bouquet of flowers in honor of Joey. I would like to thank Chewy and their employees for the kindness and compassion extended to my mom.

"I rarely ever write reviews but I just have to for Chewy. I have been ordering from Chewy for the past two years and have them on autoship every month for dog food and treats. Hands down the best customer service ever. If I ever had any issues with anything, they ALWAYS fix it and are so nice about it. A dog costume I bought didn’t fit right and I wanted to exchange it for a different size. I called so I can return the one I got and they told me to donate it to a shelter and they’ll order me a new one for free. The one I wanted didn’t come in a bigger size so the guy stayed on the phone with me for 5 more minutes looking through the site to help me choose something else I might like instead. He was funny and nice! A package I ordered said it was delivered by Fedex and we never received it. I called Chewy in a panic and they said it was no problem, they’ll send me out a new one (at no cost to me) as soon as possible. Couldn’t get any better.

We bought the monthly bark box.  I explained we have two Doberman Pinchers who are very fierce chewers. Within 2 minutes my oldest dog had a piece of a toy in the back of his throat.   This was their super chewer or whatever they call it toy box.   Very scary.  I wrote and sent pictures of broken toy and asked for refund.  I was horrified when they sent another box today.

"We have been using chewy for about 4 years now.  We started when our dog went on prescription diabetic dog food.  They have fast shipment, and friendly customer service.  When my beloved dog died, I called them up to return the food.  The man said don’t worry and to donate in my dog’s name.   They also sent me flowers and I was extremely touched.

"Chewy is HANDS DOWN the greatest pet supply company I have ever had the pleasure of purchasing from. Their customer service is beyond amazing, making each return and purchase as seamless as possible. I purchased a product for my dog back in June (JUNE!!!! It is currently October) and didn't go to use it until now. I realized I purchased the wrong item for his weight. Instead of sending the product back or making me pay a return fee, etc. - Meagan processed my refund, gave me FREE shipping for my replacement, and told me to donate the incorrect item to my local shelter instead of sending it back. I'm honestly speechless. Unrelated, they also sent my dog a birthday card on his birthday. I really appreciate such a caring business and will continue to only purchase my pet products from them.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/chewy.com,Chewy.com,http://www.chewy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/504782b500006400051ad6fc/198x149.png

"Best Customer Service - A week ago today I called Chewy because the third shipment of my cats veterinary prescribed food had arrived and I was reluctant to even open the box, because my 2 cats didn’t like the flavor anymore and stopped eating. The representative at Chewy was so courteous and helpful- she refunded the order and help me pick out a new food flavor with the same skin and stomach requirements. Now they are eating again and I am so relieved. I am so happy I called Chewy – they are the best.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/chewy.com,Chewy.com,http://www.chewy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/504782b500006400051ad6fc/198x149.png
"If I could give them no stars I would! Every thing is shipped in one giant box. The order I just received was 55lbs! I cannot lift without injury, nor can i move or drag the box in. Contacted Chewy and they said nothing they can do about it. They can do a box up to 68 lbs!!! Seriously??? They will not ship in smaller boxes. So I guess we can all sue them in small claims court when becoming injured trying to lift box. I will buy my cat food and toys etc on Amazon who has same prices as chewy and ships free with prime and you do not have to do a huge order just to get free shipping.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/chewy.com,Chewy.com,http://www.chewy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/504782b500006400051ad6fc/198x149.png

"I rate this company with 5 stars because of the efficiency and great price for the CANINE PROTEIN BUILDER - 454g C$22.00. Utopia Hemp provides my dogs with a protein builder second to none. I know that protein is one of the most essential parts of their nutrition and is often underrepresented in many feeds.  Hemp protein is one of the most easily digested fibres on the market, which can increase lean muscle mass and contains healthy fats. Utopia hemp is the best for its canine products, in particular: CANINE OIL OMEGA - 237ml. C$20.00. Adding an oil component to my dog's diet is highly beneficial.  What makes Utopia Hemp's Canine Omni - Oil Omega such a superfood is the high content of essential fatty acids and the correct ration of omega-3-6-9 and GLA.  Oil Omega is 100% natural cold pressed hemp seed oil and is highly beneficial to dogs of all ages.

Horrible customer service. I received my first and my last box. prior to receiving this box I spoke on the phone with an agent and explained what I needed.  I explained my 4 month Maltese is a teacup 4.8 lbs and teething. I explained she needs size appropriate toys and rawhide bones what I received was a toy with a tennis ball attached to it that is too big for my tiny puppy when I told them how Upset I was and sent them my YouTube video review which I did between pupjoy and barkbox. Barkbox scored a 4 because my puppy found their toys more engaging. Pupjoy scored a 1 because for $31 I received two lame toys one was too big not one chew bone or rawhide. After I sent them my review they emailed me back So sorry Zoe didn't like her box will cancel your subscription you should take her to the store and pick out her bo es and toys. Nowhere did they ask what can we do to make you and Zoe happy. They didn't even try. To chat with one of their agents is close to impossible lucky for me I had their email But after that rude response I have no interest in remaining a customer I gave them 1 star poor customer service worthless toys.Barkbox scored a 4 and I have 0 doubt Pupbox will also surpass Pupjoy,1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png
"I ran across this subscription box randomly one day and decided to try it. I signed up for the 3 month plan. Ordering was easy and they are quick to confirm with you.  My first order was sent very quickly.  It was super fun to receive a mystery box for my dogs.  I ended up with a nice plush toy, a leash, 2 different kinds of treats, and an antler chew.  The leash and all toys have already gotten a lot of use. I have only opened one of the two treats and 2 out of 3 of my dogs really enjoys them- the other one is just picky in general.  this box is a little more expensive than some of the other ones out there, but not a lot and I did feel the value of my box was more than I paid.

It's the best box out there and I've seen A LOT.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png

❤️ The opportunity to receive monthly items to spoil our dog without taking a hit in the wallet. Our pup has thoroughly enjoyed almost every product that has been shipped.

"My dogs know the PupJoy box when I bring it in from the mail!  They can't wait for me to open the box!  I have been very pleased with everything, except for one thing.  I received a treat for them that was not manufactured in the US.  I never allow my dogs any food/treat items that are not made in the US.  If it hadn't been for this one item, I would have given them 5 stars!  PupJoy is worth getting for your dog!!",4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png

Excellent products and a business with fantastic customer service - love the concept and the fun of receiving our boxes from PupJoy!,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png
"PupJoy has the most customizable boxes of any other company I have seen thus far, combined with the fact that their customer service team is amazing makes for one great company! However, they received a 3/5 because I do think their toy only boxes are a little lacking, the antler was tiny, the every day toys are often rubber or another hard plastic thats easily destroyed. Their saving grace is that usually theres one great toy and a pretty cool ""accessory"" in the box as well but considering that theres only 3 toys total I have been disappointed in the quality and type of toy. As far as companies that provide toy only boxes I think I'll stay with PupJoy but if I didn't need this option I might be tempted by the larger (and cheaper) boxes of other companies. As I said though their customer service is great, and customization is key! If they were to add some more usable toys (rubber lasts a second before I have to toss it with even the lightest chewers), I would love this company so much more!",3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png
"We originally had used a competitor but found the quality of the product declined. We decided to try PupJoy and have been very happy with the high quality, focused to our request items we receive.

PupJoy has so many options and really personalizes your package. So far so good. I look forward to my subscription coming in the mail and so does my pup!,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png
"Pupjoy came into our lives while I was reviewing other boxes online due to dissatisfaction with a different brand box. I was looking for more options, higher quality toys, and healthier treats. Pupjoy provides all that and so much more. From the moment you open their Web page you can tell that they are not another gimmicky dog box company. The design and layout of the site is professional, and warm. It is easy to navigate, and you can choose to support a rescue, and they will donate 10% of the box price to them. I love the option to buy single boxes and gift boxes as well. When it comes to options for your pooch, they are the top tier. You get options for types of treats (grain free, organic, allergy sensitive, all natural), toy type (plush, any kind, and tough chewers), size (xsmall, small, medium,  large, xlarge), how many times a year you want a box, gender (make sure to do this because you will get an amazing collar, or collar and leash, set which will be either pink or blue. Easily a 50+ dollar value from Bait Free which works to free bait dogs and rehabilitate them), payment options of every month, 3 months, 6 months, a year. All treats are made by artisan bakers, and small manufacturers, who source, and produce within the USA and Canada. No poor, dangerous products from overseas to worry about here. Also, most all of the toys I have recieved have been usa or Canadian companies and made here. This is NOT something you will ever see with other boxes on a regular basis. The treats are amazing! My dogs favorites have been blueberry cookies, freeze dried beet treats, lemon coconut balls (so pure and good I even ate one and thought about stealing the bag from her!), kale biscuits, and freeze dried bison.  To be honest, she loves them all and turns her nose up at anything store bought. The most refreshing thing is that the toys last!! Even after over three months of hard tug of war, her cow head-double tug plush/rope/squeak toy is still going strong. I get the 'inquisitive' toy option as she is hard on her toys, and I have never been let down. The variety she gets, and I have priced these companies before, along with the cost it would be to buy them at a local pet store, if I could even find them in stock, is many times what I pay per month. If there is a problem with an order, you get immediate response from their Facebook page, and quick response from an email. I recieved a personal email from the CEO Bill Wilkins explaining that he was still waiting for a supplier to come through, and gave me options on how to proceed. We decided to have him send a box of the previous months items along with the new ones he had available, and he even sent me another box that month of the items he was waiting for PLUS some extra goodies for the ""inconvenience "". He is personable, and truly cares about his customers. I couldn't be happier with a company, and I wish all companies would treat their customers as well as Pupjoy does. I am a devoted subscriber for life, and my pampered pup is very happy we are. You won't regret subscribing!",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pupjoy.com,PupJoy,http://pupjoy.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56aa93480000ff0005883773/0x0.png

"I have been waiting for my product for more than a month now. We have emailed a several times but only received 2 replies so far with possibly a wrong tracking number. Since then no reply at all. Owner says they are busy and small business, there is no problem with the small house business, in fact i do support these type of business as long as they do not over promise, and deliver what they promised to deliver such as timeframe. (they emailed me and said give 1 week to get it delivered when item has not even been shipped, and from US to Aus it takes quickest 1 week, so you already know that's not gonna happen). Very disappointed and feels like scammed this way unless there's any justified explanation. --------------------------------------------- Update Since i posted this, owner and two other customer rep staff members got in touch with me and took action quite fast within 24 hours thankfully. We will hopeully soon receive the product for our doggy baby.

Money was taken from my boyfriends account as he bought me a pair of pyjamas for my 18th birthday. Three months later still no parcel had arrived so we contacted the page via Facebook and our messages were read but not replied too. In the message we provided proof of purchase and proof that money had been taken out of our account but no email after confirming our order and no tracking either and obviously no parcel delivered. I order online all the time and while I understand mistakes happen such as orders not going through properly or parcels getting lost. The fact that it had been three months with no update on the whereabouts of our parcel and that sausage dog central had taken money from our account and didn’t bother to send a confirmation email afterwoods AND THEN didnt reply to our message stating what had happened and that we were very unhappy with there service.. Dreadful will not be purchasing from them again which is such a same because I love to spoil my sausage dogs and they have great products.

Every morning when I wake up he is there waiting to meow at me like say good morning. When he wants something I tell him  show me and he shows me what he wants.

"I already reviewed this under Aminavast, which is the current name for this product.  Then I discovered it also reviewed with even more reviews here.  Here's what I have to say. I do believe Nahmi was with me an extra year because of RenAvast (Aminavast). I had to wait until now to give my input, because I ....didn't want to ""jinx"" our situation by a good review too soon. Silly me, but I'm probably not the only one. My little one is gone now but I do believe he was with me an extra year because of RenAvast (Aminavast).. He was also getting fluids and epogen along with the RenAvast (Aminavast).. We had a touch and go time immediately after he was diagnosed. I had to syringe feed him, etc.. But then I started the RenAvast (Aminavast). and he rallied and began eating on his own. My vet said he was a miracle cat to be with me with his high numbers. It was heart failure that finally took us down. I am now giving it to my remaining kits who are all getting senior and developing elevated kidney values. I think they actually like the way it tastes. It's supposed be to tasteless but I've tried it myself and found that it seems to have ...all I can describe it as is a ""rich"" flavor. I mix a couple of capsules twice a day with a little plate of tuna and also mix with meds and baby food daily for a couple of my other kits. They gobble it right up. Just Google it.

All his kidney values went down which was proven my his blood work. But more importantly, he is eating better, has gained weight, is more playful and looks so much better (his hair prior was looking pretty bad). There have been big drug companies paying people to bad mouth this amazing product since they are threatened by its success and its effectiveness. The product was NOT pulled off the market by the FDA...the company agreed to change the name after being told its marketing was not in line with what FDA requires. FDA never had a problem with RenAvast/AminAvast's effectiveness or safety. Anyone stating this certainly has a hidden agenda.

"My cat was recently diagnosed with CRF. The bet told me aminavast (formerly renavast) was highly recommended to help manage symptoms with no side effects. My cat was doing fine, may I add, but I felt I should do whatever possible to help. I gave my cat aminavast 2x daily for only 3 days and she threw up 4 times that night. She threw up everything in her system. It was terrifying! I held off on it for a few months. Tried it again once every other day for about a week. Again, she had an episode where she made the sounds as though about to vomit but nothing came up. She acted lethargic, sad, and completely unnatural. After taking her off again, I see she wants to be around us more and seems happier. I told my vet about my experience. After doing research we found that renavast had been pulled from the market by the FDA. Now they market renavast as aminavast. My vet said they were pulling the brand from their shelves immediately. Maybe aminavast will help your animal. But if they start acting anything like my cat did, they need to be taken off of it immediately. Your experience may not be like everyone else's. I emailed renavast's customer service letting them know about our experience, but haven't received a response.

"I decided to give all my 8 rescue cats Renavast.  Two of my cats suffer from Stomatitis.  Renavast is not known to help with Stomatitis that I know of.

"Our cat Max was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure at the age of 13. RenAvast was unknown in our small town  at that time and the vet expected me to put him down, as most vets do. Looking down at the hopeful expression in those little eyes, I knew he wasn't ready to leave yet, and neither was I. Getting back home I ran to the computer to educate myself all I could on this disease (something everyone in a desperate situation should do). That's when I found the RenAvast website. I quickly ordered my first bottle, which arrived soon after. I followed the dosage according to his weight at that time, mixing it with his canned special diet.  In addition to the RenAvast, he received sub-Q treatments twice weekly and was placed on a prescription diet formulated for patients in renal failure. That was two years ago. Within 2 months after starting RenAvast, he started gaining weight and stamina, even climbing trees on occasion. I found it helpful to purchase some digital baby scales online so I could track his weight on my own rather than waiting for his next vet visit.  He loves to eat, so we have a regular battle of the bulge going on, but they feel better when their weight is under control. So don't be afraid to try this wonderful product. It's better to be safe than sorry. Guilt is a terrible thing to live with.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.renavast.com,RenAvast,http://www.renavast.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,https://consumer-assets.trustpilot.com/assets/default-business-unit-image-198x149.svg
"My cat is 18. She was lethargic around Christmas 2011. Previous cats of mine had experienced Chronic Renal Failure. I heard about Renavast and didn't believe there would be any harm in trying it. I ordered starting maybe in January 2012. It worked right away. I could tell she felt better. I don't remember whether I had the relevant lab tests done since adoption in 2005 when BUN and Creatinine were within proper range. Her test results in January 2013 were BUN 46 and Creatinine 2.3.  The results in March 2014 were BUN 45 and Creatinine 2.5. The vet says that this is all relatively good. I believe she is holding her own vis-a-vis CRF and I am glad of it. She's been taking Renavast for over 2-1/2 years and we are going to stick with it, for sure. She stays awake long hours, is attentive to whatever is going on, is calm, has a good appetite, drinks water occasionally, grooms herself, enjoys music, greets guests whenever they visit, cuddles, plays, and looks great.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.renavast.com,RenAvast,http://www.renavast.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,https://consumer-assets.trustpilot.com/assets/default-business-unit-image-198x149.svg
"In August 2012, my 9-year-old Nacho spent four days in the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney disease.  Upon his release, I had to give him sub-q injections daily.  We both hated it.  The vet tech at the animal sanctuary where I volunteer said she'd heard good things about RenAvast.  I was willing to try anything.  Within two weeks, Nacho's kidney function improved to the point where I could cut down his sub-q to every other day.  Two weeks later, we were able to reduce his sub-q to once a week.  Another two weeks....the vet took Nacho totally off the sub-q's and told me to keep doing what I was doing.  Nacho gets his blood tested every six months.  Two years later, at age 11, he's still off his sub-q and is going strong.  I still get his blood tested every six months, holding my breath until I get the results.  I am so very, very thankful to RenAvast and tell everyone I meet who has a kitty (and working at a dog and cat sanctuary, I meet a lot!).",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.renavast.com,RenAvast,http://www.renavast.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,https://consumer-assets.trustpilot.com/assets/default-business-unit-image-198x149.svg

"I put my cat on Renavast after her vet diagnosed her with kidney disease. I was pretty scared when my vet told me Wendy had already lost about 3/4 of her kidney function. And when I went home and read up on kidney disease and renal failure, I think I got even more scared. Wendy had been drinking a lot of water, wasn't as playful, and even lost a little weight. She was 17 years old and I thought I was losing her.  Well, guess what. That was 2 years ago! Wendy is eating great and looks great. I only occasionally give her fluids.

"My cat, Lil Joe, was diagnosed by my veterinarian with chronic kidney disease. My vet is an internist and very knowledgeable about the detrimental effects of this disorder. I was directed to give Joe RenAvast and was immediately skeptical. I joined a number of chat groups, and overall most had great things to say about their experience. Things like safety, side effects and in particular the research behind RenAvast were very important to me. I contacted the company, Bio Health Solutions, and they were very thorough and answered all of my questions. They weren't pushy or salesy  and expressed a sincere interest in Joe's well-being. They encouraged me to maintain regular contact with my vet, which I thought was admirable. To date, Joe appears to have more energy, has an increased appetite, has stopped vomiting and has gained weight.

"I bought a Fluval Flex glass 57L from Sedgley Road Aquarium. The staff were very helpful with their advice as to how to set it up, how much substrate, what size heater. The shop also gave advice on getting the water conditioned and testing it prior to introducing any fish to ensure no fish losses. I told them I would be using rain water so should be okay. They advised caution. I bought some plants from them and they have both true aquatic plants and semi-aquatic plants for sale. The tanks these are held in were marked up with chinagraph pencil as to which type of plant is in them. I particularly liked the shops 'grading' of fish using coloured spots with regard to peaceable community fish to those not to be trusted with smaller fish. Over the course of several weeks the water became acceptable for fish and knowing the size of my tank, the staff advised me on the type of fish to buy and introduce first. They also advised me to carry on water testing in case of a Nitrite/Nitrate spike and not to add more fish for at least a fortnight. I bought 5 neon tetras and some more plants. Towards the end of the fortnight the Nitrite/Nitrate levels started to rise. I went into the shop and told them of the rise. They advised a partial water change and sold me some water conditioning 'bacteria' to help bring the levels down. I bought some more plants. Two weeks later the levels were fine and I added 3 Harlequins and some more plants. Two weeks after that I added a pair of Guppies and some more plants. I have had no fish losses and the staff have used their knowledge and advice to help me, have the patience to (slow me down in order to), create a lovely planted aquarium.

"TLDR: Many of the aquarium plants they sell are NOT aquarium plants and will die within a couple of months. They have a large range of live plants in underwater tanks upstairs in the shop. Being new to aquatic plants I opted to purchase from the local aquatic shop, who I assumed must know what they're doing. Purchased 8 plants (in pots with labels). The labels all helpfully show how much light, what temperature and best aquarium location for the plants. Later researched on the internet on how to care for them and found 6 of the plants are not true aquatic plants and would be dead within a month or two. Not only does this feel a little dishonest, it could have a disastrous impact on water chemistry and harm any fish when the plants eventually die and decompose. Feels a bit like a scam. Tanks with a mix of aquatic and NON aquatic plants and all underwater, even the ones that can't survive underwater for long. I'm sure a lot of beginners made the mistake I did. And the shop assistant didn't mention, ""hey, you're buying some weird mix of aquatic and non-aquatic plants, do you know what you're doing?"". I brought multiples of: Hemiographis colorata, Ophiopogon kyoto, Chlorophytum bichettii. All would die underwater. Stick to buying plants off the internet where you can do proper research before purchase.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.sedgleyaquatics.co.uk,Sedgley Road Aquarium,http://www.sedgleyaquatics.co.uk?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ca9bf853ae88b0001ecbd34/198x149.png

"I placed three orders from pet solutions. All three were for saltwater fish. The first order was for a yellow breasted wrasse, it was dead on arrival.  The second order was for a Choate leopard dress, and ornate leopard wrasse  and a replacement for the dead yellow breasted wrasse.  On the day the order was supposed to ship I received an email that the order was canceled. I called to find out why and was told the Choat Wrasse was still available  but the other two weren't. When I asked why they didn't just ship the Choate grass I really didn't get an answer. I was told my $300  would be refunded in a day or two since it was a pending transaction. As of today it has been six days and still no credit. During that conversation I asked if the Choate wrasse was still available and was told it was.  like a fool I ordered two so I would be sure to get at least one I thought. I called to verify several times as a matter fact, I called the morning it was to ship. I was  told they would ship today. A little while ago they canceled my order again! Once again  I called to inquire as to why my order was canceled again and was told the Choate wrasse were out of stock. I really believe since I was standing up for myself the previous order that my Choate  wrasse were shipped to someone else over me.

However, that important piece of information is nowhere on the website so how was I supposed to know?She could not offer any solution except that they will take pay for the return shipping label. Which is really a pathetic resolution on their part. I then spoke with their manager and suggested that they ship us the individually packaged Greenies at the same cost as the ones we ordered as a one time courtesy for this inconvenience but was told no.

"I ordered 20 neon tetra and 6 angelfish from them. Delivery was 2 days. In the neon tetra bag, 4 fish were already dead and the others were pale.

Petsolutions eventually did refund my money, but to sell someone such poor quality and unhealthy fish is very very poor business, not to mention bad for the fish. I will not purchase livestock from these folks again.",1,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.petsolutions.com,PetSolutions,http://www.petsolutions.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/48173515000064000502672f/198x149.png
