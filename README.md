# End 2 End Machine Learning : From Data Collection to Deployment üöÄ 

In this post, we'll go through the necessary steps to build and deploy a machine learning application. This starts from data collection to deployment and the journey, as you'll see it, is exciting and fun üòÄ.

Before we begin, let's have a look at the app we'll be building:

    <img src="./blog-post/assets/app.gif"  style="margin:15px">
</p>

As you see, this web app allows a user to evaluate random brands by writing reviews. While writing, the user will see the sentiment score of his input updating in real-time along with a proposed rating from 1 to 5.

The user can then change the rating in case the suggested one does not reflect his views, and submit.

You can think of this as a crowd sourcing app of brand reviews with a sentiment analysis model that suggests ratings that the user can tweak and adapt afterwards.

To build this application we'll follow these steps:

- Collecting and scraping customer reviews data using Selenium and Scrapy
- Training a deep learning sentiment classifier on this data using PyTorch
- Building an interactive web app using Dash
- Setting a REST API and a Postgres database
- Dockerizing the app using Docker Compose
- Deploying to AWS

### Run the app locally


To run this project locally using Docker Compose run : 

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
You can then access the dash app at [http://localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050)

### Development

If you want to contribute to this project and run each service independently:

#### Launch API

In order to launch the API, you will first need to run a local postgres db using Docker:

```
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

Then you'll have to type the following commands:

```shell
cd src/api/
python app.py
```

#### Launch Dash app

In order to run the dash server to visualize the output:

```shell
cd src/dash/
python app.py
```


### How to contribute üòÅ

Feel free to contribute ! Report any bugs in the issue section.

Here are the few things we spotted and we wished to add.

- [ ] Add server-side pagination for Admin Page and `GET /api/reviews` route.
- [ ] Protect admin page with authentication.
- [ ] Either use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs) to deploy the app on a cluster of containers, instead of on one single EC2 instance.
- [ ] Use continuous deployment with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
- [ ] Use a managed service such as [RDD](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for the database
