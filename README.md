docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

Then you'll have to type the following commands:

```shell
cd src/api/
python app.py
```

### Launch Dash app

In order to run the dash server to visualize the output:

```shell
cd src/dash/
